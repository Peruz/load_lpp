  abstract = {Elevated CO2 levels in localized pockets of a grain mass are caused by insects, fungi, and grain metabolism. These hotspots may occur away from temperature cables in bins, silos, tanks and warehouses making early detection of spoilage difficult. For grain stored in ground piles or bunkers that typically do not have temperature cables, considerable economic loss may result in the absence of CO2 monitoring. The primary objective of this study was to monitor CO2 levels for early detection of spoilage. Three large tanks and two ground piles were monitored at a commercial grain handling facility (grain elevator) in the Midwestern U.S. Each tank held approximately 12,500 t and the ground piles held approximately 40,000 and 50,000 t of maize each. Four CO2 sensors each were installed at the top (near the vents) and base (exhaust air stream of fans) of each tank. The CO2 sensors were connected to master radios that received signals from the sensors and transmitted data wirelessly to a slave radio connected to a PC located in the office about 300 m away. For each ground pile, a sensor was installed in the air stream of several exhaust fans. The study was conducted from April -- Sept 2005 in the large tanks and from January -- May 2006 for the ground piles. The CO2 levels ranged from 500 ppm (0.05 \%) to 5,000 ppm and higher levels of up to 2.5 \% were recorded with a portable CO2 monitor. The high CO2 levels were confirmed by the extent of spoilage which ranged from 15 to 25 \% when maize was moved out from the large tanks in September 2005. CO2 monitoring of the ground piles storing newly harvested maize became an important decision-making tool for the operations manager with respect to early detection of spoilage.},

  abstract = {To investigate the potential role that indigenous microorganisms and microbial processes may play in altering lowfrequency electrical properties, induced-polarization (IP) measurements in the frequency range of 0.1 to 1000 Hz were acquired from sediment samples retrieved from a site contaminated by hydrocarbon undergoing intrinsic biodegradation. Increased imaginary conductivity and phase were observed for samples from the smear zone (contaminated with residual-phase hydrocarbon), exceeding values obtained for samples contaminated with dissolved-phase hydrocarbons, and in turn, exceeding values obtained for uncontaminated samples. Real conductivity, although generally elevated for samples from the smear zone, did not show a strong correlation with contamination. Controlled experiments on uncontaminated samples from the field site indicate that variations in surface area, electrolytic conductivity, and water content across the site cannot account for the high imaginary conductivity observed within the smear zone. We suggest that microbial processes may be responsible for the enhanced IP response observed at contaminated locations. Scanning electron microscopy and IP measurements during acid leaching indicate that etched pits on mineral surfaces --- caused by the production of organic acids or formed during microbial colonization of these surfaces --- are not the cause of the IP enhancement. Rather, we postulate that the accumulation of microbial cells (biofilms) with high surface area at the mineral-electrolyte interface generates the IP response. These findings illustrate the potential use of electrical measurements to noninvasively monitor microbial activity at sites undergoing natural hydrocarbon degradation.},

  abstract = {Lysimeters are valuable for studying the fate and transport of chemicals in soil. Large-scale field lysimeters are used to assess pesticide behaviour and radionuclide transport, and are assumed to represent natural field conditions better than laboratory columns. Field lysimeters are usually characterized by a free-draining lower boundary. As a result, the hydraulic gradient is disrupted, and leachate cannot be collected until the bottom of the lysimeter becomes saturated. We compared heterogeneously structured, free-drainage lysimeters and field soils with respect to water flow and solute transport. Numerical simulations were carried out in a two-dimensional heterogeneous sandy soil under unsaturated water flow conditions with the CHAIN\_2D code. Three different soil structures (isotropic, horizontal, and vertical) were generated, and Miller--Miller similitude was used to scale the hydraulic properties of the soil. The results showed that ponding occurs at the bottom of the lysimeter for the three soil structures and that it occurred faster and was more pronounced with the vertical structure (preferential flow effect). Breakthrough curves of a conservative solute (bromide) showed that solutes are moving faster in the field than in the lysimeters. Fewer differences between lysimeters and field soils were found with the horizontal soil structure than with the isotropic and vertical structures.},

  abstract = {During the last decades, the usage of spectral induced polarization (SIP) measurements in hydrogeology and detecting environmental problems has been extensively increased. However, the physical mechanisms which are responsible for the induced polarization response over the usual frequency range (typically 1 mHz to 10--20 kHz) require better understanding. The phase shift observed at high frequencies is sometimes attributed to the so-called Maxwell--Wagner polarization which takes place when charges cross an interface. However, SIP measurements of tap water show a phase shift at frequencies higher than 1 kHz, where no Maxwell--Wagner polarization may occur. In this paper, we enlighten the possible origin of this phase shift and deduce its likely relationship with the types of the measuring electrodes. SIP Laboratory measurements of tap water using different types of measuring electrodes (polarizable and non-polarizable electrodes) are carried out to detect the origin of the phase shift at high frequencies and the influence of the measuring electrodes types on the observed complex resistivity. Sodium chloride is used to change the conductivity of the medium in order to quantify the solution conductivity role. The results of these measurements are clearly showing the impact of the measuring electrodes type on the measured phase spectrum while the influence on the amplitude spectrum is negligible. The phenomenon appearing on the phase spectrum at high frequency (N 1 kHz) whatever the electrode type is, the phase shows an increase compared to the theoretical response, and the discrepancy (at least in absolute value) increases with frequency, but it is less severe when medium conductivity is larger. Additionally, the frequency corner is shifted upward in frequency. The dependence of this phenomenon on the conductivity and the measuring electrodes type (electrode--electrolyte interface) seems to be due to some dielectric effects (as an electrical double layer of small relaxation time formed at the electrodes interface). Therefore, this dielectric response should be taken into account at high frequency to better analytically separate the medium own response from that linked to the measuring electrodes used. We modeled this effect by adding a capacitance connected in parallel with the traditional equivalent electric circuit used to describe the dielectric response of medium.},

Estimating the potential evapotranspiration reference of particular climatic regions at different time scales, which is one of the most important atmospheric parameters, is of a particular importance in the optimal use of resources. The time series analysis method, GARCH model, is applied in order to investigate changes and estimate the potential evapotranspiration. In the present study, the efficiency of GARCH series model related to processes of modeling and estimating potential evapotranspiration, which is estimated by FAO Penman--Monteith and Hargreaves methods, was investigated. Also, future values of potential evapotranspiration are modelled and estimated at the synoptic station of Tabriz. Results showed that Time Series is considered as a precise tool to estimate evapotranspiration values. It was found that GARCH (1.1) time series has better results for FAO Penman--Monteith and Hargreaves methods compared to other models; also, it simulates the process of time series changes with less error. Observed and predicted evapotranspiration charts of both methods indicated that observational evapotranspiration was highly close to the lower limit of estimated evapotranspiration. Therefore, applying lower limit estimation as a prediction value was suggested.},

This body of research addresses possible physical effects of climatic change on agriculture, such as changes in crop and livestock yields, as well as the economic consequences of these potential yield changes. This paper reviews the extant literature on these physical and economic effects and interprets this research in terms of common themes or findings. Of particular interest are findings concerning the role of human adaptations in responding to climate change, possible regional impacts to agricultural systems and potential changes in patterns of food production and prices. Limitations and sensitivities of these findings are discussed and key areas of uncertainty are highlighted. Finally, some speculations regarding issues of potential importance in interpreting and using information on climate change and agriculture are presented.},

  abstract = {Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) is a powerful and proven tool for analyzing AC impedance response. A conventional three electrode EIS method was used to perform the investigation in the present study. Saturated potassium chloride solution was used as the electrolyte and three different material rods were used as working electrodes. Different configurations of electrode area were exposed to the electrolyte as an active area to investigate electrode geometry effects. Counter to working electrode distance was also altered while keeping the working electrode effective area constant to explore the AC response dependence on the variation of ion travel distance. Some controlled experiments were done to validate the experimental setup and to provide a control condition for comparison with experimental results. A frequency range of 100 mHz to 1 MHz was used for all experiments. In our analysis, we have found a noteworthy influence of electrode geometry on AC impedance response. For all electrodes, impedance decreases with the increase of effective area of the electrolyte. High frequency impedance is not as dependent on geometry as low frequency response. The observed phase shift angle drops in the high frequency region with increased working electrode area, whereas at low frequency the reverse is true. Resistance and capacitive reactance both decrease with an increase of area, but resistance response is more pronounce than reactance. For lower frequencies, small changes in working area produce very distinctive EIS variations. Electrode material as well as geometry was systematically varied in the present study. From these and other studies, we hope to develop a fundamental foundation for understanding specific changes in local geometry in fuel cell (and other) electrodes as a method of designing local morphology for specific performance.},

  abstract = {As plant roots take up water and the soil dries, water depletion is expected to occur in the rhizosphere. However, recent experiments showed that the rhizosphere was wetter than the bulk soil during root water uptake. We hypothesise that the increased water content in the rhizosphere was caused by mucilage exuded by roots. It is probably that the higher water content in the rhizosphere results in higher hydraulic conductivity of the root--soil interface. In this case, mucilage exudation would favour the uptake of water in dry soils. To test this hypothesis, we covered a suction cup, referred to as an artificial root, with mucilage. We placed it in soil with a water content of 0.03 cm3 cm--3, and used the root pressure probe technique to measure the hydraulic conductivity of the root--soil continuum. The results were compared with measurements with roots not covered with mucilage. The root pressure relaxation curves were fitted with a model of root water uptake including rhizosphere dynamics. The results demonstrated that when mucilage is added to the root surface, it keeps the soil near the roots wet and hydraulically well conductive, facilitating the water flow from dry soils towards the root surface. Mucilage exudation seems to be an optimal plant trait that favours the capture of water when water is scarce.},

The mature maize (Zea mays L.) root system is composed of primary, seminal, and crown roots together with their respective laterals. Our understanding of root water uptake of maize is largely based on measurements of primary and seminal roots. Crown roots might have a different ability to extract water from the soil, but their hydraulic function remains unknown. The aim of this study was to measure the location of water uptake in mature maize and investigate differences between seminal, crown, and lateral roots. Neutron radiography and injections of deuterated water were used to visualize the root architecture and water transport in 5-week-old maize root systems. Water was mainly taken up by crown roots. Seminal roots and their laterals, which were the main location of water uptake in younger plants, made a minor contribution to water uptake. In contrast to younger seminal roots, crown roots were also able to take up water from their most distal segments. The greater uptake of crown roots compared with seminal roots is explained by their higher axial conductivity in the proximal parts and by the fact that they are connected to the shoot above the seminal roots, which favors the propagation of xylem tension along the crown roots. The deeper water uptake of crown roots is explained by their shorter and fewer laterals, which decreases the dissipation of water potential along the roots.},

  abstract = {The copper causes important health problems risk when it exists at high concentrations in drinking waters and daily feeds. Therefore, in this study, copper adsorption from solutions onto illite clay was investigated in batch mode as a function of the initial solution pH (3-6), temperature (30-60 ºC) and ionic strength (0-0.1 mol/L-1 NaCl). The equilibrium was attained within 24 hours. Optimum conditions were determined as pH 6, temperature 60 ºC and 0 mol/L-1 NaCl concentration. The isotherm data followed the S-class isotherm. The reason of this S-class isotherm was either solute--solute attractive forces at the surface causing cooperative adsorption or a competing reaction such as complexation with a ligand. Mathematically, the isotherm data were explained with the sum of several single Freundlich models. Also, the thermodynamic parameters of the process were calculated. Positive values of Gibbs free energy change ({$\Delta$}Gº) indicated that the adsorption process was unspontaneous. As the enthalpy change ({$\Delta$}Hº) had positive value for all the parameter intervals, copper adsorption was concluded to be physical and endothermic process. The positive entropy values indicated that the randomness at solid-liquid interface increased with concentration decrease. Maximum copper adsorption capacity of illite clay was calculated at 60 oC as 1.823{\texttimes}10-5 mol/g. Furthermore, an empirical model was developed to determine the thermodynamic parameters of the process and operation conditions of the batch reactor as follows.},

  abstract = {Reduced chi-squared is a very popular method for model assessment, model comparison, convergence diagnostic, and error estimation in astronomy. In this manuscript, we discuss the pitfalls involved in using reduced chi-squared. There are two independent problems: (a) The number of degrees of freedom can only be estimated for linear models. Concerning nonlinear models, the number of degrees of freedom is unknown, i.e., it is not possible to compute the value of reduced chi-squared. (b) Due to random noise in the data, also the value of reduced chi-squared itself is subject to noise, i.e., the value is uncertain. This uncertainty impairs the usefulness of reduced chi-squared for differentiating between models or assessing convergence of a minimisation procedure. The impact of noise on the value of reduced chi-squared is surprisingly large, in particular for small data sets, which are very common in astrophysical problems. We conclude that reduced chi-squared can only be used with due caution for linear models, whereas it must not be used for nonlinear models at all. Finally, we recommend more sophisticated and reliable methods, which are also applicable to nonlinear models.},

  abstract = {Detailed knowledge of soil properties regulating soil water availability for the vines is of prime importance for optimal vineyard management. As soil characteristics may vary strongly over short distances, specific tools are required for efficient assessment and monitoring of soil water distribution and dynamics with fine spatial resolution. In that respect, ground-penetrating radar (GPR), electromagnetic induction (EMI) and electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) surveys were carried out in a vineyard in southern France in order to produce high-resolution maps of soil stratigraphy and to retrieve soil hydrogeophysical properties of the different soil layers. The results presented in this paper show large spatial variations in vineyard soil properties, which are in accordance with the distribution of the different soil types within the study area. This is particularly observable from EMI and ERT data, which show strong spatial correlation with large areas of comparable values delimited by well-defined discontinuities, revealing sharp variations of soil characteristics over short distances. These discontinuities almost systematically correspond to the limits of the vineyard plots, though areas of contrasting soil electrical conductivity values are also found within some plots. Furthermore, the patterns of soil electrical conductivity and resistivity are in good agreement with soil stratigraphy observed from GPR measurements. Finally, these results also highlighted anthropogenic soil compaction resulting from agricultural practices during too wet soil conditions as a likely explanation to vine vigor problems observed locally in the vineyard, which is corroborated by the observation of lower values of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for the vine in zones where soil compaction was evidenced by both geophysical measurements and soil profile description.},

Measured resistivity data were inverted and modeled by RES2DINV software to get resistivity sections. Continuous calibration along resistivity section was necessary to understand data involving sampling and physicochemical analysis. Samples were analyzed performing both biochemical methane potential and fiber quantification. Correlations were established between the protocol of reactor preparation, resistivity values, liquid content, methane potential and fiber content representing liquid repartition, high methane potential zones and degradations zones. ERT method showed a strong relevance to monitor and to optimize the dry batch anaerobic digestion process.},

In this study, such an approach is developed using physically based modeling with the numerical MCNP neutron transport code. The objective is to determine site-specific conversion functions to estimate soil moisture from CRNs for the dominant land covers. Here, we assess this methodology at three field sites with similar mineral soil composition, but different land covers. First, we ensure that the developed models capture the most important differences in neutron transport behavior across sites. For this, we use measured time series and height profiles of thermal and epithermal neutrons. Then, we compare the estimates obtained from the site-specific conversion functions with the standard N0-calibration function. Finally, we compare the CRN soil moisture estimates with independent soil moisture estimates. Overall, the site-specific models are in agreement with the observed trends in neutron intensities. The site-specific soil moisture is similar to the N0-estimated soil moisture, which results in comparable statistical measures. We show that various land covers have a significant impact on the amount and soil moisture sensitivity of epithermal neutrons, while the thermal neutrons are affected to a less degree. Thereby, thermal-to-epithermal neutron ratios can be used to identify the land cover type and thereby the appropriate conversion function for soil moisture estimation for each point along the survey route.},

Average value of extraneous moisture was 86.5 \% and an average value of atmospheric temperature was 9.17{$^\circ$}C. It was not recorded any occurrence of animal pests in stored maize grain during the storage. Grain water content differs with the change of air moisture and temperature. Reduction of grain water content is most frequently realized by residual drying (moisture is less than 15\%); the storage stability is provided at the moisture of 12\%.},

In this work, it was observed that for pH values below the isoelectric point (IEP), the positive value of zeta potential of water suspensions of {$\alpha$}-quartz and {$\alpha$}-cristobalite, experiences a sudden steep increase with the increase in specific surface area of the powders. For pH values above the IEP, the zeta potential values of crystalline forms of silica ({$\alpha$}-quartz and {$\alpha$}-cristobalite), get gradually more negative with the increase in pH. Conversely in the case of vitreous silica, for pH values above 6, there occurs a steep change towards more negative values of zeta potential than those presented by quartz and cristobalite. These findings have not yet been accounted for in the DLVO theory but may provide subsidies for better understanding of how to stabilize and destabilize crystalline and vitreous silica water suspensions.},

Thermal Dissipation Probe (TDP) sensors were installed in 5-year old (young) and 15-year old (mature) orange trees to measure the diurnal sap flu x variations in trees during November 21, 2019, to January 31, 2020 (71 days). The results show that the maximum daily water uptake by the 5-year old tree was 1.1 L observed on 39th day of measurement (December 29, 2019) and in the 15-year old tree it was 5.0 L, and it observed on 38th day (December 28, 2019) of measurement. The cumulative water uptake during the study period by the 5-year old tree was 49.0 L, and the 15-year old tree consumed 257.4 L of water. The results were compared with the recommended irrigational values of Indian Horticulture Board (IHB), Government of India (GoI) and Groundwater Survey and Development Agency (GSDA), Government of Maharashtra (GoMH) for orange orchards. The initial investigation shows that recommended guidelines for irrigation of orange trees are exorbitantly high and needs to be revised. The sap flow methods are more precise that can measure sap flow at a very short interval and can generate a time series of data. It can be used to revise the g uidelines with the aim to conserve water and propose precision water irrigation for the study area in particular and different agro-climatic zones of the country in general.},

  abstract = {Microorganisms participate in a variety of geologic processes that alter the chemical and physical properties of their environment. Understanding the geophysical signatures of microbial activity in the environment has resulted in the development of a new sub-discipline in geophysics called ``biogeophysics''. This review focuses primarily on literature pertaining to biogeophysical signatures of sites contaminated by light non-aqueous phase liquids (LNAPL), as these sites provide ideal laboratories for investigating microbialgeophysical relationships. We discuss the spatial distribution and partitioning of LNAPL into different phases because the physical, chemical, and biological alteration of LNAPL and the subsequent impact to the contaminated environment is in large part due to its distribution. We examine the geophysical responses at contaminated sites over short time frames of weeks to several years when the alteration of the LNAPL by microbial activity has not occurred to a significant extent, and over the long-term of several years to decades, when significant microbial degradation of the LNAPL has occurred. A review of the literature suggests that microbial processes profoundly alter the contaminated environment causing marked changes in the petrophysical properties, mineralogy, solute concentration of pore fluids, and temperature. A variety of geophysical techniques such as electrical resistivity, induced polarization, electromagnetic induction, ground penetrating radar, and self potential are capable of defining the contaminated zones because of the new physical properties imparted by microbial processes. The changes in the physical properties of the contaminated environment vary spatially because microbial processes are controlled by the spatial distribution of the contaminant. Geophysical studies must consider the spatial variations in the physical properties during survey design, data analysis, and interpretation. Geophysical data interpretation from surveys conducted at LNAPL-contaminated sites without a microbial and geochemical context may lead to ambiguous conclusions.},

Although coarse roots can be visualized by several methods, there are technical difficulties with root quantification. The method presented here focuses on the quantification of absorbing root surfaces through an electrical (the modified earth impedance) method. It is based on the experimentally verified fact that an applied electric current flows from the roots to the soil (or vice versa) through the same interfacial areas and predominantly in the same way as water (water solution of minerals or nutrients) flows from the soil to the tree. Based on the different conductivities of tree tissues and soil, the interfacial area, which represents the absorbing root surfaces (or root absorption zones), can be calculated. Only the theoretical description of the method is presented in this paper: the experimental verification of the method under field conditions is presented in the accompanying paper.},

  abstract = {Microbial electrochemical technologies (MET) can remove a variety of organic and inorganic pollutants from contaminated groundwater. However, despite significant laboratory-scale successes over the past decade, field-scale applications remain limited. We hypothesize that enhancing the electrochemical conductivity of the soil surrounding electrodes could be a groundbreaking and cost-effective alternative to deploying numerous high-surface-area electrodes in short distances. This could be achieved by injecting environmentally safe iron- or carbon-based conductive (nano)particles into the aquifer. Upon transport and deposition onto soil grains, these particles create an electrically conductive zone that can be exploited to control and fine-tune the delivery of electron donors or acceptors over large distances, thereby driving the process more efficiently. Beyond extending the radius of influence of electrodes, these diffuse electro-conductive zones (DECZ) could also promote the development of syntrophic anaerobic communities that degrade contaminants via direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET). In this review, we present the state-of-the-art in applying conductive materials for MET and DIET-based applications. We also provide a comprehensive overview of the physicochemical properties of candidate electrochemically conductive materials and related injection strategies suitable for field-scale implementation. Finally, we illustrate and critically discuss current and prospective electrochemical and geophysical methods for measuring soil electronic conductivitydboth in the laboratory and in the fielddbefore and after injection practices, which are crucial for determining the extent of DECZ. This review article provides critical information for a robust design and in situ implementation of groundwater electro-bioremediation processes.},

  abstract = {The paper analyzes the performance of Hydrus-2D model to simulate the dynamic of soil water contents and transpiration fluxes in an olive orchard in which two different irrigation systems were used in 2011 and 2012. The relationship between measured midday stem water potential, MSWP, and simulated relative transpiration (ratio between simulated actual and maximum crop transpiration), Ks, was also identified with the aim to use the model for crop water status predictions. Finally, a scenario analysis was carried out for irrigation management purposes, by considering the level of crop water stress achieved in the different phases of the vegetative growth. The results evidenced that active roots (d {$<$} 2.0 mm) are mainly localized along the tree row where is installed the drip irrigation pipe, with concentrations that tended to decrease at increasing depth and with the distance from the plant row. Moreover, Hydrus-2D model is generally able to reproduce the trends of measured soil water contents at different distances and depths from the plant row with RMSE equal to 0.04 cm3 cm-3 in 2011 and 0.09 cm3 cm-3 in 2012, because of the inadequate schematization of the root system, that could have changed according to the different irrigation system. Moreover, the model was also suitable to estimate actual transpiration with RMSE values, in the two years, of 0.09 and 0.05 mm. It was also observed that measured MSWPs are linearly correlated to the ratio between actual and maximum transpiration; under the examined conditions in fact, reductions of MSWP from -1.5 MPa to -3.1 MPa determined a decline of actual transpiration from about 86\% to 50\% of maximum. Finally, the performed scenario analysis evidenced the potential of the model to identify crop water status during the different stages of crop growth, that can be used to identify irrigation strategies aimed to cope with water scarcity.},

Ten cosmic-ray probes were set up in the Rur catchment located in western Germany, and calibrated by gravimetric soil sampling campaigns. Aboveground biomass was estimated at the sites to investigate the role of vegetation cover on the neutron flux and the calibration procedure. Three parameterization methods were used to generate site-specific neutron flux -- soil water content calibration curves: (i) the N0-method, (ii) the hydrogen molar fraction method (hmf-method), and (iii) the COSMIC-method. At five locations, calibration measurements were repeated to evaluate site-specific calibration parameters obtained in two different sampling campaigns. At two locations, soil water content determined by cosmic-ray probes was evaluated with horizontally and vertically weighted soil water content measurements of two distributed in situ soil water content sensor networks. All three methods were successfully calibrated to determine field scale soil water content continuously at the ten sites. The hmf-method and the COSMIC-method had more similar calibration curves than the N0-method. The three methods performed similarly well in the validation and errors were within the uncertainty of neutron flux measurements despite observed differences in the calibration curves and variable model complexity. In addition, we found that the obtained calibration parameters NCOSMIC, N0 and NS showed a strong correlation with aboveground biomass.},

Controlled grass cover is one of the most used soil conservation practices adopted in temperate climates, even if the protective effect of grass cover may decrease according to seasonal pattern. This technique is effective and, thus, widely adopted in the inter-rows of orchards such as olives, citrus or vineyards. This study reports the erosive events recorded in two different rain-fed hillslope vineyards with different rows orientation located in the Monferrato region, NW Italy. The study is addressed at compare the effects of different inter-row managements and rainfall characteristics on runoff and soil loss in hillslope vineyards (average slope from 15\% to 35\%). Rainfall, runoff and erosion variables were monitored in hydraulically bounded vineyard plots, where the interrows were managed with tillage and grass cover. Seventy-two erosive events were recorded in the period 1992--1996 in two vineyard plots with rows along the contour lines while 86 erosive events were recorded in two plots with rows up-and-down the slope from 2000 to 2014 (158 erosive events and four plots in total). Events were classified according to rainfall characteristics as ``long-lasting'', ``intense'' and ``normal''. In plots with rows along the contour lines, ``intense'' events were responsible for the highest mean soil loss in tilled plots (0.7 Mg ha-1) with very high erosion rates (12.3 Mg ha-1) observed during a single storm. In plots with rows upand-down the slope the highest erosion rates, 21.2 and 3.4 Mg ha-1, were recorded during fall ``long-lasting'' events in the tilled and grass cover plots respectively. The grass cover proved to be effective in decreasing runoff and soil losses during most of the events (at least 68\% and 61\% of the occurrences, respectively) reducing soil losses especially during summer storms when most of the ``intense'' events occured. Furthermore, the results show the fundamental role of contour-slope row orientation in reducing runoff and soil losses, disregarding the inter-rows soil management that is adopted.},

  abstract = {In this paper a new model is described for calculating the electric potential field in a long, thin nanochannel with overlapped electric double layers. Electrolyte concentration in the nanochannel is predicted self-consistently via equilibrium between ionic solution in the wells and within the nanochannel. Differently than published models that require detailed iterative numerical solutions of coupled differential equations, the framework presented here is self-consistent and predictions are obtained solving a simple one-dimensional integral. The derivation clearly shows that the electric potential field depends on three new parameters: the ratio of ion density in the channel to ion density in the wells; the ratio of free-charge density to bulk ion density within the channel; and a modified Debye--H{\"u}ckel thickness, which is the relevant scale for shielding of surface net charge. For completeness, three wall--surface boundary conditions are analyzed: specified zeta-potential; specified surface net charge density; and charge regulation. Predictions of experimentally observable quantities based on the model proposed here, such as depth-averaged electroosmotic flow and net ionic current, are significantly different than results from previous overlapped electric double layer models. In this first paper of a series of two, predictions are presented where channel depth is varied at constant well concentration. Results show that under conditions of electric double layer overlap, electroosmosis contributes only a small fraction of the net ionic current, and that most of the measurable current is due to ionic conduction in conditions of increased counterion density in the nanochannel. In the second of this two-paper series, predictions are presented where well-concentration is varied and the channel depth is held constant, and the model described here is employed to study the dependence of ion mobility on ionic strength, and compare predictions to measurements of ionic current as a function of channel depth and ion density.},

  abstract = {During droughts, soil evaporation is often constrained by water vapor transport through an air-dry soil layer (DSL). Fick's water vapor diffusion is widely regarded as the only process for such transport; however, field studies conducted in arid and semi-arid conditions showed measured evaporation rates higher than those predicted by diffusion. Therefore, transport processes other than diffusion could be relevant. To study the evaporation through a DSL, the same lysimeter column with 70 cm thick DSL as earlier applied in laboratory in Balugani et al. (2021), was installed in the field in Spain applying an original weighing setup to measure evaporation. The correlation between the measured evaporation and possible drivers of the water vapor transport were evaluated. With the DSL thickness of 70 cm in 2012 and 12 cm in 2015, the lysimeter recorded similar groundwater evaporation rates: 1.25 and 1.05 mm days{$\mkern1mu-$}1, respectively; these rates were much larger than the laboratory recorded rates (0.3 mm days{$\mkern1mu-$}1) and those estimated in this study using Hydrus1D accounting for non-isothermal liquid water fluxes and water vapor diffusion. The main forcing driver of the field lysimeter evaporation was the soil profile temperature fluctuation, which concealed other less important forcing factors, that is, atmospheric pressure fluctuations and diffusion. A multivariate regression model to estimate evaporation was proposed, based on the profile temperature fluctuation, that, when added to the atmospheric pressure fluctuations, yielded reliable estimates of the cumulative evaporation measured in both 2012 and 2015.},

  abstract = {The constitutive relationship between water content or degree of saturation and suction is called the soil-water characteristic curve. The soil-water characteristic curve provides a conceptual framework in which the behavior of unsaturated soils can be understood. A historical review illustrates how the work of early researchers in soil science and geotechnical engineering laid the foundation for our current understanding of this relationship. Key elements of these early studies were a conceptual understanding of the soil-water characteristic curve as a relationship between the mass or volume of water stored within the soil and the energy in the water phase. It was on the basis of this conceptual model that current methods of measuring the soil-water characteristic curve were developed. Interpretative models for the distribution and geometry of the water phase in an unsaturated soil based on the capillary model have provided a useful conceptual model for understanding the effects of soil texture, gradation, void ratio, and compaction on the soil-water characteristic curve. The capillary model has also provided the foundation for recently developed techniques to predict the functional relationship between degree of saturation and shear strength, coefficient of permeability, coefficient of diffusion, and adsorption for unsaturated soils.Key words: unsaturated soils, soil-water characteristic curve, suction, shear strength, permeability, contaminant transport.},

Yet much of what we know about plant stress responses is based on studies where the microbial partners were uncontrolled and unknown. Under climate change, the soil microbial community will also be sensitive to and respond to abiotic and biotic stressors. Thus, facilitating plant adaptation to climate change will require a systems-based approach that accounts for the multi-dimensional nature of plant--microbe--environment interactions. In this perspective, we highlight some of the key factors influencing plant--microbe interactions under stress as well as new tools to facilitate the controlled study of their molecular complexity, such as fabricated ecosystems and synthetic communities. When paired with genomic and biochemical methods, these tools provide researchers with more precision, reproducibility, and manipulability for exploring plant--microbe--environment interactions under a changing climate.},

Geologic and hydrologic studies of the Salado conducted since the mid1970's have led to the development of a conceptual model of the hydrogeology of the formation that involves far-field permeability in anhydrite layers and at least some impure halite layers. Pure halite layers and some impure halite layers may not possess an interconnected pore network adequate to provide permeability. Pore pressures are probably very close to lithostatic pressure. In the near field around an excavation, dilation, creep, and shear have created and./or enhanced permeability and decreased pore pressure. Whether flow occurs in the far field under natural gradients or only after some threshold gradient is reached is unknown. If far-field flow does occur, mean pore velocities are probably on the order of a meter per hundreds of thousands to tens of millions of years.},

  abstract = {Abstract. A good understanding of the soil water content (SWC) distribution at the field scale is essential to improve the management of water, soil and crops. Recent studies proved that Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) opens interesting perspectives in the determination of the SWC distribution in 3 dimensions (3-D). This study was conducted (i) to check and validate how ERT is able to monitor SWC distribution in a maize field during the late growing season; and (ii) to investigate how maize plants and rainfall affect the dynamics of SWC distribution. Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) measurements were used to validate ERT-inverted SWC values. Evolution of water mass balance was also calculated to check whether ERT was capable of giving a reliable estimate of soil water stock evolution. It is observed that ERT was able to give the same average SWC as TDR (R2 = 0.98). In addition, ERT gives better estimates of the water stock than TDR thanks to its higher spatial resolution. The high resolution of ERT measurements also allows for the discrimination of SWC heterogeneities. The SWC distribution showed that alternation of maize rows and inter-rows was the main influencing factor of the SWC distribution. The drying patterns were linked to the root profiles, with drier zones under the maize rows. During short periods, with negligible rainfall, the SWC decrease took place mainly in the two upper soil horizons and in the inter-row area. In contrast, rainfall increased the SWC mostly under the maize rows and in the upper soil layer. Nevertheless, the total amount of rainfall during the growing season was not sufficient to modify the SWC patterns induced by the maize rows. During the experimental time, there was hardly any SWC redistribution from maize rows to inter-rows. Yet, lateral redistribution from inter-rows to maize rows induced by potential gradient generates SWC decrease in the inter-row area and in the deeper soil horizons.},

During the last decade, NMR has become increasingly popular in near-surface geophysics due to substantial improvements in instrumentation, data processing, forward modeling, inversion, and measurement techniques. This paper starts with a description of the principal theory and applications of NMR. It presents a basic overview of near-surface NMR theory in terms of its physical background and discusses how NMR relaxation times are related to different relaxation processes occurring in porous media. As a next step, the recent and seminal near-surface NMR developments at each scale are discussed, and the limitations and challenges of the measurement are examined. To represent the growth of applications of near-surface NMR, case studies in a variety of different near-surface environments are reviewed and, as examples, two recent case studies are discussed in detail. Finally, this review demonstrates that there is a need for continued research in near-surface NMR and highlights necessary directions for future research. These recommendations include improving the signal-tonoise ratio, reducing the effective measurement dead time, and improving production rate of surface NMR (SNMR), reducing the minimum echo time of borehole NMR (BNMR) measurements, improving petrophysical NMR models of hydraulic conductivity and vadose zone parameters, and understanding the scale dependency of NMR properties.},

Over past few decades, a number of impedance based noninvasive tissue characterization techniques such as bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), electrical impedance plethysmography (IPG), impedance cardiography (ICG), and electrical impedance tomography (EIT) have been proposed and a lot of research works have been conducted on these methods for noninvasive tissue characterization and disease diagnosis. In this paper BIA, EIS, IPG, ICG, and EIT techniques and their applications in different fields have been reviewed and technical perspective of these impedance methods has been presented. The working principles, applications, merits, and demerits of these methods has been discussed in detail along with their other technical issues followed by present status and future trends.},

  abstract = {The application of percolation theory to porous media is closely tied to network models. A network model is a detailed model of a porous medium, generally incorporating pore-scale descriptions of the medium and the physics of pore-scale events. Network models and percolation theory are complementary: while network models have yielded insight into behavior at the pore scale, percolation theory has shed light, at the larger scale, on the nature and effects of randomness in porous media. This review discusses some basic aspects of percolation theory and its applications, and explores work that explicitly links percolation theory to porous media using network models. We then examine assumptions behind percolation theory and discuss how network models can be adapted to capture the physics of water, air and solute movement in soils. Finally, we look at some current work relating percolation theory and network models to soils.},

While the electrical characteristics of OECTs are analogous to those of conventional organic field effect transistors, appropriate models for OECTs have not yet been developed. In particular, little is known about the transient characteristics of OECTs, which are determined by a complex interplay between ionic and electronic motion. In this paper a simple model is presented that reproduces the steady-state and transient response of OECTs by considering these devices in terms of an ionic and an electronic circuit. A simple analytical expression is derived that can be used to fit steady-state OECT characteristics. For the transient regime, comparison with experimental data allowed an estimation of the hole mobility in poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) doped with poly(styrene sulfonate). This work paves the way for rational optimization of OECTs.},

  abstract = {Adsorption of metals by clay minerals is a complex process controlled by a number of environmental variables. The present work investigates the removal of Cu(II) ions from an aqueous solution by kaolinite, montmorillonite, and their poly(oxo zirconium) and tetrabutylammonium derivatives. The entry of ZrO and TBA into the layers of both kaolinite and montmorillonite was confirmed by XRD measurement. The specific surface areas of kaolinite, ZrO-kaolinite, TBA-kaolinite, montmorillonite, ZrO-montmorillonite, TBA-montmorillonite were 3.8, 13.4, 14.0, 19.8, 35.8 and 42.2 m2/g, respectively. The cation exchange capacity (CEC) was measured as 11.3, 10.2, 3.9, 153.0, 73.2 and 47.6 meq/100 g for kaolinite, ZrOkaolinite, TBA-kaolinite, montmorillonite, ZrO-montmorillonite, TBA-montmorillonite, respectively. Adsorption increased with pH till Cu(II) ions became insoluble in alkaline medium. The kinetics of the interactions suggests that the interactions could be best represented by a mechanism based on second order kinetics (k2 = 7.7 {\texttimes} 10-2 to 15.4 {\texttimes} 10-2 g mg-1 min-1). The adsorption followed Langmuir isotherm model with monolayer adsorption capacity of 3.0--28.8 mg g-1. The process was endothermic with H in the range 29.2--50.7 kJ mol-1 accompanied by increase in entropy and decrease in Gibbs energy. The results have shown that kaolinite, montmorillonite and their poly(oxo zirconium) and tetrabutyl-ammonium derivatives could be used as adsorbents for separation of Cu(II) from aqueous solution.},

The modification was predominantly done by pillaring with various polyoxy cations of Zr4+, Al3+, Si4+, Ti4+, Fe3+, Cr3+or Ga3+, etc. Preparation of pillared clays with quaternary ammonium cations, namely, tetramethylammonium-, tetramethylphosphonium- and trimethyl-phenylammonium-, N{$\prime$}-didodecyl-N, N{$\prime$}-tetramethylethanediammonium, etc, are also common. Moreover, the acid treatment of clays often boosted their adsorption capacities. The adsorption of toxic metals, viz., As, Cd, Cr, Co, Cu, Fe, Pb, Mn, Ni, Zn, etc., have been studied predominantly. Montmorillonite and its modified forms have much higher metal adsorption capacity compared to that of kaolinite as well as modified-kaolinite.},

The site is comprised of the original landfill site called the old landfill (OL), in operation from 1976 to 1999, and a newer section known as the new cell (NC) which operated from 1999 to 2002. The objective of this study is to determine, using electrical resistivity tomography (ERT), the extent of the leachate plume from the OL and to monitor the efficiency of the liner of the NC. The entire Etueffont site was crisscrossed with 21 electrical profile lines which were traced in summer between 2009 and 2011 during a period of dry weather. This investigation allowed visualization of the flow and saturation phenomena within the waste without destructive on-site intervention, and also of leachate infiltration into the substratum. The anomalies of low resistivity extending beneath the base of the OL represent a leachate plume that migrates within the substratum. As the water table ceiling is found at nearly the same level as the base of the waste, leachate infiltration is a source of groundwater pollution. A rising gradient in resistivity values is observed at depth indicating progressive vertical dilution in leachate mineralization. Pollution plume extension is limited both at depth and laterally as it is no longer visible a few dozen meters from the storage zone.},

The induced and remanent magnetizations were obtained by varying the 3-D orientation of each item and measuring the magnetic field on a horizontal plane in the dipolar regime. Replicate measurements using multiple specimens of the same ordnance returned very similar induced magnetizations. The fitted moments were used to estimate the detection depths for different sensor noise floors. A prolate spheroid with a 3.5 aspect ratio was used to provide a good approximation to the detection depths for many of the ordnance items. Assuming a 1 nT noise floor,these orientation dependent detection depths ranged from 10 to 17 times the object's diameter.},

  abstract = {Geophysics provides a multidimensional suite of investigative methods that are transforming our ability to see into the very fabric of the subsurface environment, and monitor the dynamics of its fluids and the biogeochemical reactions that occur within it. Here we document how geophysical methods have emerged as valuable tools for investigating shallow subsurface processes over the past two decades and offer a vision for future developments relevant to hydrology and also ecosystem science. The field of ``hydrogeophysics'' arose in the late 1990s, prompted, in part, by the wealth of studies on stochastic subsurface hydrology that argued for better field-based investigative techniques. These new hydrogeophysical approaches benefited from the emergence of practical and robust data inversion techniques, in many cases with a view to quantify shallow subsurface heterogeneity and the associated dynamics of subsurface fluids. Furthermore, the need for quantitative characterization stimulated a wealth of new investigations into petrophysical relationships that link hydrologically relevant properties to measurable geophysical parameters. Development of time-lapse approaches provided a new suite of tools for hydrological investigation, enhanced further with the realization that some geophysical properties may be sensitive to biogeochemical transformations in the subsurface environment, thus opening up the new field of ``biogeophysics.'' Early hydrogeophysical studies often concentrated on relatively small ``plot-scale'' experiments. More recently, however, the translation to larger-scale characterization has been the focus of a number of studies. Geophysical technologies continue to develop, driven, in part, by the increasing need to understand and quantify key processes controlling sustainable water resources and ecosystem services.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Geophysical surveys are now commonly used in agriculture for mapping applications. High-throughput collection of geophysical properties such as electrical conductivity (inverse of resistivity) can be used as a proxy for soil properties of interest (e.g., moisture, texture, salinity). Most applications only rely on a single geophysical survey at a given time. However, time-lapse geophysical surveys have greater capabilities to characterize the dynamics of the system, which is the focus of this work. Assessing the impact of agricultural practices through the growth season can reveal important information for the crop production. In this work, we demonstrate the use of time-lapse electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and electromagnetic induction (EMI) surveys through a series of three case studies illustrating common agricultural practices (cover crops, compaction with irrigation, and tillage with N fertilization). In the first case study, time-lapse EMI reveals the initial effect of cover crops on soil drying and the absence of effect on the subsequent main crop. In the second case study, compaction leading to a shallower drying depth for potatoes (               Solanum tuberosum               L.) was imaged by time-lapse ERT. In the third case study, larger changes in electrical conductivity over time were observed in conventional tillage compared with direct drill using time-lapse EMI. In addition, different N application rates had a significant effect on the yield and leaf area index but only ephemeral effects on the dynamics of electrical conductivity, mainly after the first application. Overall, time-lapse geophysical surveys show great potential for monitoring the impact of different agricultural practices that can influence crop yield.                        ,              Core Ideas                                                                Time-lapse geophysical surveys can help assess the impact of agricultural practices.                                                     Cover crops affect soil drying while in place but have no substantial effect on the main crop.                                                     Traffic-induced soil compaction limits water extraction depths of potato crops.                                                     The soil electrical conductivity in moldboard plowing decreases faster than in direct drill.                                                     N levels have significant impact on the soil EC after application, but not over a longer term.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Characterization of the shallow subsurface in mountain catchments is important for understanding hydrological processes and soil formation. The depth to the soil/bedrock interface (e.g., the upper {\textasciitilde}5 m) is of particular interest. Frequency domain electromagnetic induction (FDEM) methods are well suited for high productivity characterization for this target as they have short acquisition times and do not require direct coupling with the ground. Although traditionally used for revealing lateral electrical conductivity (EC) patterns, e.g., to produce maps of salinity or water content, FDEM inversion is increasingly used to produce depth-specific models of EC. These quantitative models can be used to inform several depth-specific properties relevant to hydrological modeling (e.g. depths to interfaces and soil water content). Material and methods: There are a number of commercial FDEM instruments available; this work compares a multi-coil device (i.e., a single-frequency device with multiple receiver coils) and a multi-frequency device (i.e., a single receiver device with multiple frequencies) using the open-source software EMagPy. Firstly, the performance of both devices is assessed using synthetic modeling. Secondly, the analysis is applied to field data from an alpine catchment. Results: Both instruments retrieved a similar EC model in the synthetic and field cases. However, the multi-frequency instrument displayed shallower sensitivity patterns when operated above electrically conductive grounds (i.e., 150 mS/m) and therefore had a lower depth of investigation. From synthetic modeling, it also appears that the model convergence for the multi-frequency instrument is more sensitive to noise than the multi-coil instrument. Conclusion: Despite these limitations, the multi-frequency instrument is smaller and more portable; consequently, it is easier to deploy in mountainous catchments.},

To speed up the breeding process, it is important to understand how plants react to extreme weather events such as drought or waterlogging in their production environment, i.e. under field conditions in real soils. Whereas a number of techniques exist for aboveground field phenotyping, simultaneous non-invasive belowground phenotyping remains difficult. In this paper, we present the first data set of the new HYDRAS (HYdrology, Drones and RAinout Shelters) open-access field-phenotyping infrastructure, bringing electrical resistivity tomography, alongside drone imagery and environmental monitoring, to a technological readiness level closer to what breeders and researchers need. This paper investigates whether electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) provides sufficient precision and accuracy to distinguish between belowground plant traits of different genotypes of the same crop species. The proof-of-concept experiment was conducted in 2023, with three distinct soybean genotypes known for their contrasting reactions to drought stress. We illustrate how this new infrastructure addresses the issues of depth resolution, automated data processing, and phenotyping indicator extraction. The work shows that electrical resistivity tomography is ready to complement drone-based field-phenotyping techniques to accomplish whole-plant high-throughput field phenotyping.},

  abstract = {Hydrologic connectivity is the linkage of separate regions of a catchment via water flow. Knowledge of hillslope--stream connectivity (both at the surface and in the subsurface) is essential for understanding and predicting runoff responses and streamwater quality. Connectivity can be very dynamic: hillslopes may connect to the stream only during certain events or seasons. While surface connectivity is often discussed, particularly in the context of sediment transport, subsurface connectivity is more difficult to describe and assess. This difficulty has led to a wide variety in methodologies that are used in various contexts. Field approaches have focused on intensive monitoring of processes on the hillslope or the fingerprint of connectivity in the stream. Combining experimental studies with modeling allows for testing of hypotheses with respect to thresholds and controls on connectivity, and extrapolation from the hillslope scale to the catchment scale. However, as most modeling approaches are based on datasets from a few intensively studied hillslopes, this carries the inherent risk of oversimplification because it assumes that the observed hillslope responses are representative for the catchment or even the region. Focussed efforts on catchment scale assessment of hillslope--stream connectivity, as well as site intercomparisons and the search for similarity measures may allow us to capture the wider picture of the mechanisms and factors that control hillslope--stream connectivity, and its effects on flow and transport at the catchment scale. This overview focuses on how hillslope--stream connectivity has been studied and describes the advantages, disadvantages, and challenges of the different methods.

  abstract = {Abstract             The role of root water uptake in regulating soil water saturation in salt marshes is controversial. Modeling studies suggest that soil aeration is improved by transpiration, with implications for the distribution of vegetation species and of the associated topographic features controlling the hydraulic regime of the marshland and eventually its survival. Marsh vegetation plays a key role in the preservation of such critical environment, which represents unique marker for climatic change and impact studies. However, the direct quantification of space-time aeration patterns has remained elusive, in part, because of the limitations posed by high salinity to conventional observation techniques such as time or frequency domain reflectometry. Here we show that time-lapse microscale electrical resistivity tomography, coupled with tensiometric observations, allows the identification of variably saturated zones and the characterization of space-time soil moisture dynamics in a salt marsh in the Venice Lagoon (Italy). This is the first quantitative observational experiment which confirms that periodically flooded plants are capable of producing a persistently aerated layer below the flooded surface when transpiration proceeds at a sufficiently high rate. The experimental results are compared against previously published model predictions.           ,              Key Points                                                                Halophytes improve the aeration of the soil, in the proximity of their roots                                                     Halophytes induce persisting aerated layer also in periodically flooded systems                                                     Our results bear significant implications for the spatial distribution of plants},

  abstract = {Hydrogeophysics is a rapidly evolving discipline emerging from geophysical methods. Geophysical methods are nowadays able to illustrate not only the fabric and the structure of the underground, but also the subsurface processes that occur within it, as fluids dynamic and biogeochemical reactions. This is a growing wide interdisciplinary field, specifically dedicated to revealing soil properties and monitoring processes of change due to soil/bio/atmosphere interactions. The discipline involves environmental, hydrological, agricultural research and counts application for several engineering purposes. The most frequently used techniques in the hydrogeophysical framework are the electric and electromagnetic methods because they are highly sensitive to soil physical properties such as texture, salinity, mineralogy, porosity and water content. Non-invasive techniques are applied in a number of problems related to characterization of subsurface hydrology and groundwater dynamic processes. Ground based methods, as electrical tomography, proved to obtain considerable resolution but they are difficult to extend to wider exploration purposes due to their logistical limitation. Methods that don't need electrical contact with soil can be, on the contrary, easily applied to broad areas. Among these methods, a rapidly growing role is played by frequency domain electro-magnetic (FDEM) survey. This is due thanks to the improvement of multi-frequency and multi-coils instrumentation, simple time-lapse repeatability, cheap and accurate topographical referencing, and the emerging development of inversion codes. From raw terrain apparent conductivity meter, FDEM survey is becoming a key tool for 3D soil characterization and dynamics observation in near surface hydrological studies. Dozens of papers are here summarized and presented, in order to describe the promising potential of the technique.},

  abstract = {Landslides occur extensively in all countries of the world. A landslide is a complex geologic body composed of a combination of layers having contrasting and gradational physical properties. In assessing the danger of landslides, it is of prime importance to investigate the structure of the landslide slope and its water saturation as well as the properties and status of the soils comprising the slope. The investigation and full evaluation of all these problems by traditional methods of engineering geology are sometimes impossible. Electrical and seismic methods are used to obtain the information needed to determine slope stability. Experience has been gained from longterm investigations carried out in various regions of the Soviet Union. Applications include evaluating geologic and hydrologic conditions related to the occurrence of landslides. Primary attention is devoted to the study of landslide slopes proper. The geologic structure of a landslide is considered in modeling it and determining the thickness of both the landslide body and the slip zone. The methods of self-potential, resistivity, and temperature measurement are analyzed for characterization of the seepage flow through the landslide body. Self-potential, resistivity, and temperature anomalies are associated with sites of increased landslide activity. Useful engineering properties of soils may be obtained from field and laboratory geophysical measurements. Measurement of changes of geophysical parameters with time are significant in assessing changes in the states of landslide soils. Observation of the direction and velocity of landslide movements is possible with magnetic and electrical methods. Examples of geophysical investigations of landslides in the Crimea, on the Black Sea coast of the Caucasus, and in the Volga River Valley are presented.},

  abstract = {Bio-engineered slopes use vegetation as ``live'' protection elements against the triggering forces of landslides, erosions and debris flows. In this paper, the effects of basic plant traits (both root and shoot) on their slope stability functions in compacted and planned green slopes have been reviewed. This review is based on over 200 papers on areas primarily related to unsaturated soil mechanics, plant biology, hydrology and ecology. The first section of this paper gives an overview of the plant-soil--water continuum, highlighting the key interactions that determine reinforcing actions of vegetation in sloped soil. The hydraulic pathway (water flow from roots to atmosphere) and plant response at varying soil stress (suction) is explained. Thereafter, the effects of inherent plant properties (bio-polymer composition, plant physiological parameters and root morphology) on soil reinforcement are discussed. The second section discusses the three stability functions (i.e., mechanical, hydrological and interception reinforcements) of vegetation in slopes. The first two subsections considering mechanical and hydrological reinforcement action are catalogued. In the third subsection, the interception functions of plant (both shoot and root parameters) against erosion and debris flow are illustrated based on experimental, numerical and field observations. In the last section, the knowledge gaps on the topic of bioengineered slope stability are highlighted such as the consideration of plant age effect, plantation strategy and high suction response of vegetation. The possible negative effects of vegetation towards slope stability resulting from extreme climate conditions such as extended droughts, forest fires, freeze--thaw cycles and elevated CO2 concentration levels are discussed. The review identifies new research themes for developing futuristic bioengineered slopes. The potential of real time monitoring and maintenance of bio-engineered slopes, redefinition of wilting point and concept of ``plant sensors'' are also put forth.},

As a result of an analysis of the electrical conductivity, basic experiments on sandstones at frequencies below 10 kHz show that the complex behaviour of conductivity is caused exclusively by a complex interface conductivity. Its value is determined mainly by the internal rock interface to porosity ratio, the composition of the pore fluid and connected matrix-water interactions resulting in a specific microstructure of the interface. Therefore, it can be expected that the interface region of a soil or rock material is very sensitive to changes in composition caused by contamination. Contaminated sandstone and clay samples were investigated using a low-frequency measurement system. The investigations are directed at the influence of different contaminants and their concentration. Results show that the complex electrical conductivity (real and imaginary parts) is influenced by properties of the pore-filling contaminant. This influence results in a change of the level of both parts and the shape of their frequency dependence. The imaginary part in particular seems to provide important secondary information; in some cases this part alone allows a differentiation of the various contaminants. The different behaviour of various rock types shows that the effects observed are the result of interactions between pore fluid properties and the internal pore surface structure.},

Of particular interest are the links between electrical resistivity and near-surface moisture content; recent work has demonstrated that it is possible to calibrate hydrological models using geophysical measurements. In this study we explore the use of in-field electrical resistivity data for calibrating unsaturated soil retention parameters and saturated hydraulic conductivity used for modeling unsaturated fluid flow. We study a synthetic case study, and a well-characterized site in the northeast of England and develop an approach to calibrate retention parameters for a mudstone and a sandstone formation, the former being an actively failing unit. Petrophysical relationships between electrical resistivity and moisture content (or saturation) are established for both formations. 2D hydrological models are driven by effective rainfall estimations; subsequently these models are coupled with a geophysical forward model via a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach. For the synthetic case, we show that our modeling approach is sensitive to the moisture retention parameters, while less so to saturated hydraulic conductivity. We observe the same characteristics and sensitivities for the field case, albeit with a greater data misfit. Further hydrological simulations suggest that the slope retained high moisture contents in the months preceding a rotational failure. Therefore, we propose that coupled hydrological and geophysical modeling approaches could aid in enhancing landslide monitoring, modeling, and early warning efforts.},

The heavy metal tolerance of native species of Sesbania from the Argentinean Pampas is poorly documented. The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of interactions between copper, zinc and chromium, in binary form, on Sesbania virgata biomass, absorption and translocation. The HM transfer from a contaminated soil to plants and into plant tissues are discussed in terms of the Bioconcentration Factor (BCF) and the Transfer Factor (TF). In a pot experiment, HM were added either individually or in binary mixture solutions of Cu, Zn and Cr, in low or high doses. In all treatments, the main accumulation of HM appeared in plant roots, and Zn is more removed from soils by S. virgata (BCF average in roots Zn {$>$} Cr {$>$} Cu). In the binary mixture of Cu and Zn, Sesbania plants absorbed the highest concentrations of these metals. In contrast, Cr was more absorbed in the individual treatments. While the co-presence of metals resulted in a greater reduction in S. virgata biomass than the presence of a single metal, S. virgata tolerated and stabilized high concentrations of Cu, Zn and Cr. In view of this tolerance, S. virgata is excellent specie to be used for heavy metals phytostabilization in contaminated soils.},

  abstract = {Electrical spectral induced polarization (SIP) measurements are increasingly being used in environmental studies of the saturated zone. To better understand the mechanisms causing polarization and to extend the range of SIP applications to the vadose zone, it is important to investigate how the SIP response is affected by water saturation. Therefore, sand and sand-clay mixtures were drained in several steps using a novel measurement set-up allowing SIP measurements with a high accuracy. The measured SIP spectra were interpreted by Debye decomposition, which provided a relaxation time distribution and a chargeability distribution that was converted to a normalized total chargeability. The results showed that the normalized total chargeability of the fully saturated samples increased with increasing clay content due to the larger specific surface area of the clay minerals. Furthermore, normalized total chargeability first increased and then decreased with decreasing saturation for the pure sand and the 5\% sand-clay mixture. The normalized total chargeability values for the 10\% and 20\% sand-clay mixtures only decreased with saturation. The peak relaxation time of the sand-clay mixtures clearly decreased with decreasing saturation. Existing grain-size based mechanistic models for SIP are not able to explain the observed behaviour and the observed relationship between relaxation time and saturation suggests that model concepts relying on polarization processes in the pore space are warranted to explain the measurements on variably saturated porous media presented here.},

This study investigated the possibility of extending the use of ER to measure plant available soil water variables, i.e. available soil water (ASW), total transpirable SW (TTSW), and fraction of transpirable SW (FTSW) using a pedotransfer approach. In a vineyard, 224 electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) transects and 672 time domain reflectometry (TDR) soil water profiles were acquired over 2 years. Soil physical--chemical properties were measured on 73 soil samples from eight different sites. To estimate the amount of soil water available to plants, grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) water status was monitored by means of leaf water potentials. A benchmark experiment was carried out to compare four machine-learning techniques: multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), k-nearest neighbours (KNN), random forest (RF), and gradient boosting machine (GBM). Model interpretation led to a deeper understanding of the relationships between electrical resistivity and soil properties when predicting soil water availability for the plant. The models assessed had good predictive performance and were therefore used to map ASW, TTSW and FTSW in the vineyard. ER coupled to machine-learning algorithms was shown to be a good proxy for quantification and visualisation of plant available soil water with low disturbance.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Assessing spatiotemporal variations in soil water is critical to many decisions in precision agriculture. In dryland crop production regions with marginal precipitation, growers use crop rotations and surface preparation practices to build soil water natural capital over preceding seasons for cash crop production. However, significant gaps exist in quantifying linkages between topography, soil properties, and site-specific agronomic practices to crop water use, and to predict temporal changes in soil water storage. In this study, we used time-lapse electromagnetic induction to measure apparent electrical conductivity (EC               a               ) to infer spatiotemporal variability of soil water while comparing crop (winter wheat [               Triticum aestivum               L.], spring peas [               Pisum sativum               L.], and spring barley [               Hordeum vulgare               L.]) as well as tillage (no till and chisel plow) on a split-plot design in the Palouse region of northern Idaho. Weekly measurements of EC               a               were converted to soil water content using multiple linear regression with the help of principal component analysis. Separating factors of temporal stability and variability allowed us to derive crop-specific calibrated relationships between soil water content and the additional variables growing degree days, elevation, clay content, and silt content. Results suggest that spring peas retained the highest water content, followed by spring barley and winter wheat. Resultant maps show highly structured and consistent patterns in EC               a               being driven primarily by crop type that are apparent even in uncalibrated imagery. Although soil EC               a               tended to be greater in no-tillage compared with chisel plow treatments, we found no significant differences in soil water content between the two.

In a French Mediterranean region (De{\^A} partement de l'He{\^A} rault), the total Cu content observed in the upper layer of vineyard soils ranged from 31 to 250 mg kg{\`A}1, versus 14 to 29 mg kg{\`A}1 in woodland plots. Cu distribution with soil depth showed that Cu input from Cu treatment was essentially concentrated in the upper layers, except for two soil pro{\textregistered}les which presented Cu enrichments in deep horizons. EDTA, DTPA and ammonium acetate-extractable Cu were highly correlated with soil total Cu, and were weakly correlated with Cu content in wild plants grown in the plots. These observations suggested that these extraction methods are of limited interest for predicting the availability of Cu to plants in Cu-contaminated soils. In comparison, CaCl2 extractable Cu was not correlated to total Cu and depended mainly on soil pH. When the soil pH increased the quantities of extractable Cu decreased. For soil with neutral to acid pH, CaCl2 extractable Cu was correlated with the contents observed in wild plants. It thus appeared as the best way of predicting plant-available Cu in vineyard soils. \# 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The repeated use of copper (Cu) fungicides to control vine downy mildew has led to long-term accumulation of Cu in vineyard soils which now raises the issue of the potential bioavailability of Cu for various living organisms including plant species. The bioavailable Cu can be de{\textregistered}ned as the portion of soil Cu that can be taken up by roots, for a given plant species. In order to evaluate the bioavailability of Cu to plants, a pot experiment was conducted in glasshouse conditions with a crop species (maize) and 12 soils sampled in the upper horizon of 10 vineyard plots (total Cu ranging from 38 to 251 mg kg{\`A}1) and two woodland plots (control soils that had not received any Cu application; total Cu amounting to 20{\textpm}26 mg kg{\`A}1). These soils were selected for their diverse physical (large range of particle size distribution) and chemical (from acid to calcareous soils) properties. After 35 days of growth, plant shoots were harvested for analysis. The roots were separated from soil particles for further analysis. The concentrations of Cu in the roots and aerial parts of the maize were then compared with the amounts of Cu extracted from the soil by a range of conventional extractants. Observed Cu concentrations in maize roots which have grown in contaminated vineyard soils were very high (between 90 and 600 mg kg{\`A}1), whereas Cu concentrations in the aerial parts varied only slightly and remained low ({$<$}18 mg kg{\`A}1). Root Cu concentrations observed for maize increased with increasing total Cu content in the soil and with decreasing soil CEC. Cu accumulation in maize roots may be as high in calcareous soils as in acid soils, suggesting that soil pH had little in{\textasciimacron}uence. In the case of the vineyard soils studied, the lack of correlation found for maize between Cu concentrations in roots and in the aerial parts, suggests that an analysis of the aerial parts would not be a good indicator of plant Cu uptake, as it provides no insight into the real amount of Cu transferred from the soil to the plant. For maize, our results show that extraction with organic complexing agents (EDTA, DTPA) and extraction with ammonium acetate seem to provide a reasonably good estimate of root Cu concentration. \# 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

  abstract = {Abstract. Improving the quantification of soil thermal and physical properties is key to achieving a better understanding and prediction of soil hydro-biogeochemical processes and their responses to changes in atmospheric forcing. Obtaining such information at numerous locations and/or over time with conventional soil sampling is challenging. The increasing availability of low-cost, vertically resolved temperature sensor arrays offers promise for improving the estimation of soil thermal properties from temperature time series, and the possible indirect estimation of physical properties. Still, the reliability and limitations of such an approach need to be assessed. In the present study, we develop a parameter estimation approach based on a combination of thermal modeling, sliding time windows, Bayesian inference, and Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation to estimate thermal diffusivity and its uncertainty over time, at numerous locations and at an unprecedented vertical spatial resolution (i.e., down to 5 to 10\,cm vertical resolution) from soil temperature time series. We provide the necessary framework to assess under which environmental conditions (soil temperature gradient, fluctuations, and trend), temperature sensor characteristics (bias and level of noise), and deployment geometries (sensor number and position) soil thermal diffusivity can be reliably inferred. We validate the method with synthetic experiments and field studies. The synthetic experiments show that in the presence of median diurnal fluctuations\,{$\geq$}\,1.5\,{$\circ$}C at 5\,cm below the ground surface, temperature gradients\,{$>$}\,2\,{$\circ$}C\,m-1, and a sliding time window of at least 4\,d the proposed method provides reliable depth-resolved thermal diffusivity estimates with percentage errors\,{$\leq$}\,10\,\% and posterior relative standard deviations\,{$\leq$}\,5\,\% up to 1\,m depth. Reliable thermal diffusivity under such environmental conditions also requires temperature sensors to be spaced precisely (with accuracy to a few millimeters), with a level of noise\,{$\leq$}\,0.02\,{$\circ$}C, and with a bias defined by a standard deviation\,{$\leq$}\,0.01\,{$\circ$}C. Finally, the application of the developed approach to field data indicates significant repeatability in results and similarity with independent measurements, as well as promise in using a sliding time window to estimate temporal changes in soil thermal diffusivity, as needed to potentially capture changes in bulk density or water content.},

We have, therefore, started from the analytical model of a frequency domain coincident loop system over a homogeneous half-space to calculate directly the voltage induced in the system's receive coil, for a number of scenarios and soil parameters of interest, and with emphasis on the operating conditions prevailing in humanitarian demining applications. The role of the soil's permeability, which heavily affects the real part of the system's response function, has been clearly shown (plateau effect at low-frequencies), as well as the effects of changes in the detector's height. Some of the background rejection techniques used in practice, in particular frequency differencing methods to suppress the effect of magnetic and/or conductive soil, have been described as well, and two of them studied in more detail, including the unavoidable target response reduction. Finally, we have briefly dealt with the effect of a conductive soil on the primary and scattered fields themselves, which could affect in a nonadditive way the target signature.

  abstract = {Analysis of common methods of detecting subsurface metallic objects was carried out. It was shown that these conventional methods lack the optimum combination of such characteristics as sensitivity, selectivity, designability and they can't be applied universally. The research group developed a new combined method of subsurface exploration, which makes use of two basic control methods, such as the method registering the reaction of electromagnetic field parameters on the internal or the surface impedance of the environment during the propagation of the electromagnetic field in it and the method registering the reaction of the input impedance of a receiving antenna on electromagnetic properties of the explored environment. When the suggested method is implemented, information is registered by means of three information measuring channels, namely, by the two channels of the receiving ferrite magnetic antenna (to provide measuring of current values of the voltage amplitude of the active and reactive components of the output signal) and by the third channel of the radiating loop antenna to provide measuring of the current value of the excitation current amplitude. It was proved that this method could provide the range extension of the monitored parameters and improve the accuracy of detection of the subsurface objects thus improving its information capacity and enlarging its range of application. This improves the efficiency of the subsurface exploration processes on the whole.},

  abstract = {Processes related to the membrane-like behaviour of pore throats are generally considered relevant for the induced polarization of granular media. A model to describe the impedance of membrane polarization analytically was suggested previously for a 1-D system, consisting of a sequence of narrow and wide pores of different lengths. In that model, the membrane effect is caused by different mobilities of the ion species, resulting in different ion transference numbers in the two pore types. We extend the model by explicitly including the properties of the electrical double layer and the pore radii into the impedance calculation. Our basic assumption is that in a cylindrical pore system, the ion concentrations in the direction perpendicular and parallel to the pore are independent of each other. We then obtain concentrations averaged over the pore section from known theories of the charge distribution in a cylindrical pore. We also include the effect of the Stern layer in form of a partition coefficient. Our extension enables us to use the analytical expression of the impedance, but with an extended parametrization of the transference numbers. We demonstrate the validity of our approach by comparing the results of our calculations with previously published numerical simulations for a particular model. The usefulness of our method is illustrated with parameter studies that illustrate the possible dependence of relaxation times on pore radii.},

  abstract = {We have developed an extension of the theory and mathematical description of the commonly used Wong model of electrode polarization. The full solution of the Poisson-Nernst-Planck system is provided, including three additional unknown coefficients, which describe the microscale polarization response at the surface of a perfectly conducting particle. The model involves two simultaneously acting polarization mechanisms. The first is related to the dynamic charging of diffuse layers induced over the poles of the particles, which relaxes on a time scale proportional to the particle radius and Debye length of the electrolyte solution. The second is a volume-diffusion mechanism, which is activated by reaction currents through the solid-liquid interface, i.e., faradaic currents due to charge-transfer reactions. The relaxation time of the resulting concentration polarization around the particle increases quadratically with the particle radius and the fraction of electroactive cations in the electrolyte. Although diffuse-layer polarization dominates the effective response for small particles and in the absence of reactive cations, volume-diffusion polarization only affects the macroscopic behavior if the particle size exceeds a critical value. From the closed-form analytic expressions for both relaxation times that we used, we derive a critical particle radius that depends on Debye length and reactive cation concentration. Based on the improved understanding of the underlying polarization processes, we also review some recent conceptual models of metallic polarization and correct several physical misconceptions inherent to these reinterpretations of the classic theory.},

  abstract = {Numerical simulations are carried out to study the induced-polarization response of a charged metallic sphere, which immersed in electrolyte solution is covered by a static diffuse layer. The metallic sphere itself is assumed to be perfectly conductive; electromigration and diffusion processes in bulk electrolyte and diffuse layer are modeled by the Poisson-Nernst-Planck system of partial differential equations. To include the effect of a fixed diffuse charge, we consider a constant electric [Formula: see text]-potential at the surface of the particle, which leads to the buildup of a static diffuse layer. Furthermore, a minor fraction of electroactive cations engages in oxidation-reduction reactions at the particle surface, which allows charges to be transferred across the solid-liquid interface. Upon excitation by a low-frequency electric field, we observe the coupling of three polarization processes in the composite material consisting of metallic particle and surrounding electrolyte. The first is related to the dynamic charging of field-induced diffuse layers immediately outside the two hemispheres of the sphere. The other two are volume-diffusion processes: (1)~one driven by the reaction currents through the particle surface and (2)~the other driven by the unequal electromigration transport of anions and cations through the static diffuse layer. Diffuse-layer relaxation and volume diffusion due to reaction currents can also be observed around uncharged metallic particles and clearly dominate the macroscopic polarization response. The [Formula: see text]-surface potential at the particle surface, and thus the static diffuse layer, only moderately change the relaxation of the field-induced diffuse layer: With the increasing magnitude of the [Formula: see text]-potential, we observe an increase of the low-frequency electrical conductivity of the particle in suspension, a reduction of its polarization magnitude, and a shift of its characteristic frequency toward lower frequencies. The volume-diffusion process due to the reaction currents remains practically unaffected by the static diffuse layer.},

We have summarised the current understanding of how agricultural inputs affect the amounts, activity, and diversity of soil organisms. Mineral fertilisers have limited direct effects, but their application can enhance soil biological activity via increases in system productivity, crop residue return, and soil organic matter. Another important indirect effect especially of N fertilisation is soil acidification, with considerable negative effects on soil organisms. Organic amendments such as manure, compost, biosolids, and humic substances provide a direct source of C for soil organisms as well as an indirect C source via increased plant growth and plant residue returns. Non-target effects of microbial inoculants appear to be small and transient. Among the pesticides, few significant effects of herbicides on soil organisms have been documented, whereas negative effects of insecticides and fungicides are more common. Copper fungicides are among the most toxic and most persistent fungicides, and their application warrants strict regulation. Quality control of organic waste products such as municipal composts and biosolids is likewise mandatory to avoid accumulation of elements that are toxic to soil organisms.},

However, the analytical models that are used to interpret push-pull data may be over-simplified, and potentially overlook important processes responsible for the frequent discrepancy between predicted and observed results obtained from push-pull tests. In this study, the limitations underlying the push-pull test methodology were investigated and were supported with results from a push-pull test conducted in a sulphate-reducing aquifer contaminated by crude oil. Poor ( {$<$} 7\%) mass recovery was achieved when the push-pull test was performed in a fast-flowing aquifer, preventing a quantifiable reaction rate to be determined. Breakthrough curve data were unexplainable using simplified analytical models, but exhibited trends analogous with tests conducted by others, when {$>$}20\% mass recoveries were achieved. Push-pull test data collected from sulphate-reducing aquifers indicate that the assumption of a well-mixed batch reactor system is incorrect and that reaction rates obtained from pushpull tests in such systems may be affected by the extraction regime implemented. Evidence of microbial respiration of the reactive tracer was provided by stable sulphur isotope analysis, from which an isotope fractionation factor of +9.9 {\AE}8.1\% was estimated. The stable isotope data support the argument that reaction rates calculated using push-pull tests are not uniformly distributed in space and time and are likely to be influenced by heterogeneities in the flow field.},

  abstract = {The managing and monitoring of natural and artificial river levees are crucial in order to reduce the hydrological risk. As these hydraulic structures are very extensive, the typically applied techniques (e.g. geotechnical soundings and visual inspections) provide only punctual information that are generally focused on areas already recognized as troublesome. To overcome these well-known issues, non-invasive and cost-effective geophysical measurements have been proposed (and used) to supply spatially extensive data that should be integrated with direct investigations. Therefore, in this paper we present the joint use of multichannel analysis of surface waves (MASW), electrical resistivity tomography (ERT), and ground penetrating radar (GPR) to characterize a reconstructed river embankment (made of concrete and tout-venant) prone to serious leakages. We compare common lengthwise ERT profiles, performed from the levee crest, with cross-embankment and cross-river profiles, showing how relying only on the first type of surveys may lead to misinterpretations. Furthermore, we take advantage of a land-streamer for the MASW surveys and of a trans-illumination approach to improve the GPR application. The comparison between geophysical and geotechnical data helps identify the spatial extent of the volume actually invaded by grouting injections, which appears as a highly electrically conductive mean. The lack of homogeneity within this domain, highlighted by the cross-embankment ERT profiles, can be related to the seepage phenomena affecting this artificial levee. Therefore, this case study demonstrates the effectiveness of combining direct and non-invasive investigations for the characterization of river embankments.},

A low frequency electrical current is applied to the flowing suspension by two flush-mounted electrodes on the pipe wall to create a potential field which is sampled by other pairs of flush-mounted electrodes. A numerical inversion of the data, which takes into account the geometry and symmetry of the problem, gives the conductivity variation within the flow. An image of the suspension particle volume fraction in the tube is then formed using a relationship between the local conductivity and local suspension concentration. Consistent with particle shear migration of a concentrated suspension at low Reynolds number, the images from experimental data show a net migration of particles toward the centerline of the tube. The images of a 0.25 volume fraction suspension at the lowest Reynolds number examined compare favorably to an existing continuum theory of particle shear migration. Other images from experiments at higher, but still small Reynolds numbers, and at volume fractions of 0.25 and 0.40 are also presented. The particle migration measured with the relatively inexpensive EIT at the latter condition is in very good agreement with the particle distribution measured with magnetic resonance imaging by Hampton et al. [J. Rheol. 41, 621 (1997)].},

  abstract = {The demand for freshwater resources has increased in recent times and has been exacerbated by escalating global population and increasing drought indices in the world's agricultural zones. Irrigated agriculture is inevitably a wasteful water user that has deprived other sectors of the scarce resource. Improving water use efficiency in irrigated agriculture is therefore crucial for sustainable agricultural production to thrive. There is potential to improve water use efficiency through smart irrigation systems, especially with the advent of wireless communication technologies, monitoring systems, and advanced control strategies for optimal irrigation scheduling. This paper reviews state-of-the-art smart monitoring and irrigation control strategies that have been used in recent years for irrigation scheduling. From the literature review, closed-loop irrigation control strategies are efficient than open-loop systems which do not cater for uncertainties. It is argued that combining soil-based, plant, and weather-based monitoring methods in a modelling environment with model predictive control can significantly improve water use efficiency. This review shall help researchers and farmers to choose the best irrigation monitoring and control strategy to improve irrigation scheduling in open field agricultural systems.},

  abstract = {Electrical transport properties of saturated porous media, such as soils, rocks and fractured networks, typically composed of a non-conductive solid matrix and a conductive brine in the pore space, have numerous applications in reservoir engineering and petrophysics. One of the widely used electrical conductivity models is the empirical Archie's law that has a practical application in well-log interpretation of reservoir rocks. The Archie equation does not take into account the contributions of clay minerals, isolated porosity, heterogeneity in grains and pores and their distributions, as well as anisotropy. In the literature, either some modifications were presented to apply Archie's law to tight and clay-rich reservoirs or more modern models were developed to describe electrical conductivity in such reservoirs. In the former, a number of empirically derived parameters were proposed, which typically vary from one reservoir to another. In the latter, theoretical improvements by including detailed characteristics of pore space morphology led to developing more complex electrical conductivity models. Such models enabled us to address the electrical properties in a wider range of potential reservoir rocks through theoretical parameters related to key reservoir-defining petrophysical properties. This paper presents a review of the electrical conductivity models developed using fractal, percolation and effective medium theories. Key results obtained by comparing experiential and theoretical models with experiments/ simulations, as well as advantages and drawbacks of each model are analyzed. Approaches to obtaining more reasonable electrical conductivity models are discussed. Experiments suggest more complex relationships between electrical conductivity and porosity than experiential models, particularly in low-porosity formations. However, the available theoretical models combined with simulations do provide insight to how microscale physics affects macroscale electrical conductivity in porous media.},

Results Transpiration rate decreased at higher soil matric potential in sand than in loam at both VPD levels. In sand, high VPD generated a steeper drop in canopy conductance with decreasing leaf water potential. The decrease in canopy conductance was well correlated with the drop in Ksp, which was significantly affected by soil texture. Conclusions Our results demonstrated that variations in canopy conductance were not simply a function of leaf water potential but largely affected by soil hydraulics.

A path-based description of surface flow across the drainage basin is used, with several options for identifying flow directions, for separating channel cells from hillslope cells, and for representing stream channel hydraulic geometry. Lakes and other topographic depressions are identified and specially treated as part of the preprocessing procedures applied to the digital elevation data for the catchment. Threshold-based boundary condition switching is used to partition potential (atmospheric) fluxes into actual fluxes across the land surface and changes in surface storage, thus resolving the exchange fluxes, or coupling, between the surface and subsurface modules. Nested time stepping allows smaller steps to be taken for typically faster and explicitly solved surface runoff routing, while a mesh coarsening option allows larger grid elements to be used for typically slower and more compute-intensive subsurface flow. Sequential data assimilation schemes allow the model predictions to be updated with spatiotemporal observation data of surface and subsurface variables. These approaches are discussed in detail, and the physical and numerical behavior of the model is illustrated over catchment scales ranging from 0.0027 to 356 km               2               , addressing different hydrological processes and highlighting the importance of describing coupled surface-subsurface flow.},

  abstract = {Evapotranspiration is one of the most difficult terms of the water balance to estimate and model, because of its complex links with atmospheric, hydrological, and ecological processes. In this paper we show how a switching procedure for the boundary conditions at the soil surface achieves a good description of evapotranspiration in a catchment-scale process-based hydrological model. The switching algorithm relies on one parameter, a threshold soil water pressure head (wmin), to distinguish between atmosphere-controlled and soil-limited evapotranspiration. We successfully applied the model to a small water-limited catchment in southwestern Victoria, Australia, mainly used as pasture and where an extensive hydrological data set is available. Our simulation results show that the model is capable of reproducing satisfactorily the hydrological regime of the catchment without the need for a detailed multiparameter calibration. Specifically, the observed daily flow hydrographs, typical of ephemeral streams, are reproduced satisfactorily for both the calibration and validation phases. Water table levels proved to be more difficult to match, even though the overall groundwater dynamics are well captured by the model. The comparison between measured and observed evapotranspiration rates demonstrates the capability of wmin to describe the conversion of potential evaporative demand into actual evapotranspiration. The effect of wmin on the components of the catchment water balance and the model numerical performance were investigated for two different soil types through a sensitivity analysis. The modeled reduction of evapotranspiration with decreasing soil water potential is shown to be analogous to the commonly adopted Feddes formulation of water stress. The results show that the boundary conditionswitching algorithm, with a proper choice of wmin and soil retention curves, can represent a simple and effective way to account for the impacts exerted on the catchment hydrological response by shallow rooted vegetation.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            In arid and semiarid climate catchments, where annual evapotranspiration (               ET               ) and rainfall are typically comparable, modeling               ET               is important for proper assessment of water availability and sustainable land use management. The aim of the present study is to assess different parsimonious schemes for representing               ET               in a process-based model of coupled surface and subsurface flow. A simplified method for computing               ET               based on a switching procedure for the boundary conditions of the Richards equation at the soil surface is compared to a sink term approach that includes root water uptake, root distribution, root water compensation, and water and oxygen stress. The study site for the analysis is a small pasture catchment in southeastern Australia. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis carried out on the parameters of the sink term shows that the maximum root depth is the dominant control on catchment-scale               ET               and streamflow. Comparison with the boundary condition switching method demonstrates that this simpler scheme (only one parameter) can successfully reproduce               ET               when the vegetation root depth is shallow (not exceeding approximately 50 cm). For deeper rooting systems, the switching scheme fails to match the               ET               fluxes and is affected by numerical artifacts, generating physically unrealistic soil moisture dynamics. It is further shown that when transpiration is the dominant contribution to               ET               , the inclusion of oxygen stress and root water compensation in the model can have a considerable effect on the estimation of both               ET               and streamflow; this is mostly due to the water fluxes associated with the riparian zone.                        ,              Key Points:                                                                Simple, parsimonious ET schemes for integrated hydrological models are assessed                                                     Boundary condition switching is suitable only for shallow root depths                                                     Oxygen stress and root water compensation influence riparian zone ET dynamics},

  abstract = {Data assimilation applications in integrated surface-subsurface hydrological models (ISSHMs) are generally limited to scales ranging from the hillslope to local or meso-scale catchments. This is because ISSHMs resolve hydrological processes in detail and in a physics-based fashion and therefore typically require intensive computational efforts and rely on ground-based observations with a small spatial support. At the other end of the spectrum, there is a vast body of literature on remote sensing data assimilation for land surface models (LSMs) at the continental or even global scale. In LSMs, some hydrological processes are usually represented with a coarse resolution and in empirical ways, especially groundwater lateral flows, which may be very important and yet often neglected. Starting from the review of some recent progress in data assimilation for physics-based hydrological models at multiple scales, we stress the need to find a common ground between ISSHMs and LSMs and suggest possible ways forward to advance the use of data assimilation in integrated hydrological models.},

Willow cuttings with and without roots were set in a constant electric field (effective voltage of 0.1 V, sine-AC, 128 Hz) in a hydroponic solution. The electrical resistance of different components in the measurement system was measured and analysed in relation to root surface area in contact with the cultivation solution. Axial resistivities of single root segments and of stems were measured. The results showed that the resistance decreased in relation to an increase in the contact surface area of the roots with the solution. The resistance depended strongly on the contact area of the stem with the solution, however, thus causing bias in the evaluation of root surface area. This work is a new contribution for the understanding of current pathways in the root system as exposed to an external electric field and for developing a non-destructive method to study plant roots accordingly. It may be concluded that the electrical resistance method is a useful non-destructive method to study roots and their physiological properties. Electrical analogues for roots and stem comprising resistors are discussed in relation to in situ measurements.},

  abstract = {The Cathedral of Saint Gerland, located on the top of the hill of Agrigento, is an important historical church, which dates back to the Arab--Norman period (XI century). Unfortunately throughout its history the Cathedral and the adjacent famous Archaeological Park of the `Valley of the Temples' have been affected by landslides. In this area the interleaving of calcarenites, silt, sand and clay is complicated by the presence of dislocated rock blocks and cavities and by a system of fractures partly filled with clay or water. Integrated geophysical surveys were carried out on the north side of the hill, on which the Cathedral of Agrigento is founded, to define lithological structures involved in the failure process. Because of the landslide, the cathedral has been affected by fractures, which resulted in the overall instability of the structure. Along each of four footpaths a combination of 2D electrical resistivity tomographies (ERT) and 2D seismic refraction tomographies (SRT) was performed. Moreover, along two of these footpaths microtremor (HVSR) and surface wave soundings (MASW) were carried out to reconstruct 2D sections of shear waves velocity. Furthermore a 3D electrical resistivity tomography was carried out in a limited area characterized by gentle slopes. After a preliminary phase, in which the data were processed independently, a subsequent inversion of seismic and electrical data was constrained with stratigraphic information obtained from geognostic continuous core boreholes located along the geophysical lines. This process allowed us to significantly increase the robustness of the geophysical models. The acquired data were interpolated to construct 3D geophysical models of the electrical resistivity and of the P-wave velocity. The interpolation algorithm took into account the average direction and immersion of geological strata. Results led to a better understanding of the complexity of the subsoil in the investigated area. The use of integrated geophysical techniques allowed us to understand the sliding processes that affect the slope delimiting the possible rock volume affected by the sliding. These results should be useful to define the works to consolidate the landslides affecting the slope on which the Cathedral is founded and the hill inside the Archaeological Park.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Monitoring soil structure is of paramount importance due to its key role in the critical zone as the foundation of terrestrial life. Variations in the arrangement of soil components significantly influence its hydro-mechanical properties and therefore its impact on the surrounding ecosystem. In this context, soil compaction resulting from inappropriate agricultural practices not only affects soil ecological functions, but also decreases the water-use efficiency of plants by reducing porosity and increasing water loss through superficial runoff and enhanced evaporation. In this study, we compared the ability of electric and electromagnetic geophysical methods, i.e.,~electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and frequency-domain electromagnetic (FDEM) method, to assess the effects caused by both heavy plastic soil deformations generated by a super-heavy vehicle and the more common tractor tramlines on silty-loam soils. We then tested correlations between geophysical response and soil variables (i.e.,~penetration resistance, bulk density, and volumetric water content on collected samples) at different homogeneous areas defined by k-means clustering. This work is intended to be a contribution to clarify expectations about the use of geophysical techniques to rapidly investigate soil compaction at various spatial scales, dissecting their suitability and limitations. It also aims to contribute to the methodological optimization of agrogeophysical acquisitions and data processing in order to obtain accurate soil models through a non-invasive approach. Electrical prospecting has finer spatial resolution and allows a tomographic approach, requiring higher logistic demands and the need for ground galvanic contact. On the other hand, contactless electromagnetic induction methods can be quickly used to define the distribution of electrical conductivity in the shallow subsoil in an easier way. In general, compacted soil portions are imaged as high-electrical-conductivity anomalies relative to the context. Results, validated with traditional soil characterization, show the pros and cons of both techniques and how differences in their spatial resolution heavily influence the ability to characterize compacted areas with good confidence.},

  abstract = {The spatial forest structure that drives the functioning of these ecosystems and their response to global change is closely linked to edaphic conditions. However, the latter properties are particularly difficult to characterize in forest areas developed on karst, where soil is highly rocky and heterogeneous. In this work, we investigated whether geophysics, and more specifically electromagnetic induction (EMI), can provide a better understanding of forest structure. We use EMI (EM31, Geonics Limited, Ontario, Canada) to study the spatial variability of ground properties in two different Mediterranean forests. A naturally post-fire regenerated forest composed of Aleppo pines and Holm oaks and a monospecific plantation of Altlas cedar. To better interpret EMI results, we used electrical resistivity tomography (ERT), soil depth surveys, and field observations. Vegetation was also characterized using hemispherical photographs that allowed to calculate plant area index (PAI). Our results show that the variability of ground properties contribute to explaining the variability in the vegetation cover development (plant area index). Vegetation density is higher in areas where the soil is deeper. We showed a significant correlation between edaphic conditions and tree development in the naturally regenerated forest, but this relationship is clearly weaker in the cedar plantation. We hypothesized that regular planting after subsoiling, as well as sylvicultural practices (thinning and pruning) influenced the expected relationship between vegetation structure and soil conditions measured by EMI. This work opens up new research avenues to better understand the interplay between soil and subsoil variability and forest response to climate change.},

  abstract = {The identification of organic pollutants in the soil and the subsurface is a goal of primary importance in the management of contaminated sites. However, only a few non-invasive techniques can be useful towards this goal. One such technique is spectral induced polarization. In this study, we investigate the spectral induced polarization effect of changing fluid saturation in a well-characterized porous medium, analysing the difference between air and hydrocarbons, at different degrees of water saturation. The experiments were conducted on fine eolic sand samples coming from an experimental site near Turin, Italy. Octanol and benzene were used as non-aqueous phase liquids. Samples were initially saturated with water having controlled electrical conductivity and subsequently de-saturated stepwise with injection of air at known pressure. The eolic sand samples were then re-saturated with the same water contaminated with hydrocarbons and then a non-aqueous phase liquid phase (either octanol or benzene) was injected in volumetric steps, in order to compare the effects of air and non-aqueous phase liquid invasion. At each saturation step, spectral induced polarization measurements were conducted in the 0.01 Hz to 1 kHz range using the ZEL-SIP04 impedance meter developed at the Forschungszentrum Juelich. The measurement setup guaranteed a 1 mrad phase precision for the entire frequency measurement range. Measurements were conducted under temperature controlled conditions at 20 ({\textpm}0.5){$^\circ$} C. All spectral induced polarization curves show a peak in the range 0.01--1 Hz that changes in intensity and frequency with varying saturation and a high-frequency phase shift increase dominated by capacitive coupling effects of the measuring system. A multiple Cole-Cole model was fitted to the data. The effects of de-saturation on the low-frequency Cole-Cole parameters are that a) resistivity increases with decreasing water saturation but increases less with non-aqueous phase liquid than with the same volume of air; b) chargeability increases with decreasing water saturation but in presence of non-aqueous phase liquids its value is sometimes lower, sometimes higher and sometimes similar to the one observed in presence of air; c) the time constant {$\tau$} increases with decreasing water saturation and is consistently larger with non-aqueous phase liquid than with air. These differences between air and non-aqueous phase liquid injection can be explained in terms of differences in non-aqueous phase distribution within the porous medium, as observed by X-ray micro-CT: while air is homogeneously distributed, non-aqueous phase liquids segregate under density effects. In summary, all spectral induced polarization effects of air and non-aqueous phase liquid injection in the considered porous medium are volumetric, i.e., are not due to interaction with grain surfaces or other electrical-chemical effects but are caused by pore obstruction by the electrically non-conductive phase.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Mass and energy exchanges between soil, plants and atmosphere control a number of key environmental processes involving hydrology, biota and climate. The understanding of these exchanges also play a critical role for practical purposes e.g. in precision agriculture. In this paper we present a methodology based on coupling innovative data collection and models in order to obtain quantitative estimates of the key parameters of such complex flow system. In particular we propose the use of hydro-geophysical monitoring via "time-lapse" electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) in conjunction with measurements of plant transpiration via sap flow and evapotranspiration (ET) from eddy covariance (EC). This abundance of data is fed to spatially distributed soil models in order to characterize the distribution of active roots. We conducted experiments in an orange orchard in eastern Sicily (Italy), characterized by the typical Mediterranean semi-arid climate. The subsoil dynamics, particularly influenced by irrigation and root uptake, were characterized mainly by the ERT set-up, consisting of 48 buried electrodes on 4 instrumented micro-boreholes (about 1.2 m deep) placed at the corners of a square (with about 1.3 m long sides) surrounding the orange tree, plus 24 mini-electrodes on the surface spaced 0.1 m on a square grid. During the monitoring, we collected repeated ERT and time domain reflectometry (TDR) soil moisture measurements, soil water sampling, sap flow measurements from the orange tree and EC data. We conducted a laboratory calibration of the soil electrical properties as a function of moisture content and porewater electrical conductivity. Irrigation, precipitation, sap flow and ET data are available allowing for knowledge of the system's long-term forcing conditions on the system. This information was used to calibrate a 1-D Richards' equation model representing the dynamics of the volume monitored via 3-D ERT. Information on the soil hydraulic properties was collected from laboratory and field experiments. The successful results of the calibrated modelling exercise allow for the quantification of the soil volume interested by root water uptake (RWU). This volume is much smaller (with a surface area less than 2 m\textsuperscript{2}, and about 40 cm thick) than expected and assumed in the design of classical drip irrigation schemes that prove to be losing at least half of the irrigated water which is not taken up by the plants.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Accurate monitoring and modeling of soil--plant systems are a key unresolved issue that currently limits the development of a comprehensive view of the interactions between soil and atmosphere, with a number of practical consequences including the difficulties in predicting climatic change patterns. This paper presents a case study where time-lapse minimal-invasive 3D micro-electrical tomography (ERT) is used to monitor rhizosphere eco-hydrological processes in an apple orchard in the Trentino region, Northern Italy. In particular we aimed at gaining a better understanding of the soil--vegetation water exchanges in the shallow critical zone, as part of a coordinated effort towards predicting climate-induced changes on the hydrology of Mediterranean basins (EU FP7 CLIMB project). The adopted strategy relied upon the installation of a 3D electrical tomography apparatus consisting of four mini-boreholes carrying 12 electrodes each plus 24 mini-electrodes on the ground surface, arranged in order to image roughly a cubic meter of soil surrounding a single apple tree. The monitoring program was initially tested with repeated measurements over about one year. Subsequently, we performed three controlled irrigation tests under different conditions, in order to evaluate the water redistribution under variable root activities and climatic conditions. Laboratory calibration on soil samples allowed us to translate electrical resistivity variations into moisture content changes, supported also by in-situ TDR measurements. Richards equation modeling was used also to explain the monitoring evidence. The results clearly identified the effect of root water uptake and the corresponding subsoil region where active roots are present, but also marked the need to consider the effects of different water salinity in the water infiltration process. We also gained significant insight about the need to measure quantitatively the plant evapotranspiration in order to close the water balance and separate soil structure effects (primarily, hydraulic conductivity) from water dynamics induced by living plants.},

Laboratory experiments were conducted to test the hypothesis that these anomalously high conductivities can result from products of LNAPL biodegradation. Soil from a hydrocarbon-impacted site with anomalously high conductivities was washed repeatedly to remove soluble constituents, recontaminated with diesel fuel (DF), and the pores filled with water to simulate a saturated smear zone. Nutrients were provided at levels observed at the site, which resulted in anaerobic conditions due to DF biodegradation. Within [Formula: see text], the increase in specific conductivity from microbial activity was [Formula: see text], caused by an increase in total dissolved solids (DS) of over [Formula: see text]. The increase in DS was due to mineral (mostly carbonate) dissolution and to the production of organic acids and biosurfactants. Under aerobic conditions (i.e., without added nutrients) products of DF biodegradation increased the total DS and conductivity by [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text], respectively. The results show that products of LNAPL biodegradation can drastically increase the conductivity at impacted sites.},

  abstract = {We analyzed the phenomenology of microtremor H/V curves under inversions in the shear-wave velocity (Vs) profile in the subsoil. Under no Vs inversion the spectral signature of the H/V peaks is found to be `eye-shaped' with the horizontal components higher than the vertical. Conversely, under negative velocity gradients, numerous of differences emerge. I) A H/V ratio below 1 is observed for a wide range of frequencies, due to the decrease of the horizontal components below the vertical one. II) In the presence of persistent H/V {$<$} 1, small bumps in the H/V ratio given by local minima in the vertical spectral component may represent the relics of the peaks indicating resonances and stratigraphic discontinuities. As a consequence, in the presence of velocity inversions the H/V {$>$} 2 SESAME (2004) criterion fails but a stratigraphic interpretation may still be possible. III) The H/V curves should always be interpreted together with the single component spectra. IV) Microtremor H/V measurements for stratigraphic/microzonation purposes on stiff artificial soils, (asphalt, concrete, cement, pavements) should always be avoided since the latter often produce velocity inversions. This may have consequences in the intermediate to high frequency domain ({$>$} 1 Hz) also in the application of reference site methods, like Hsite/Hbedrock, to microtremor. Theoretical modeling confirms these experimental findings.},

  abstract = {Noninvasive geophysical techniques based on the dispersion of surface waves in layered media are commonly used approaches for measuring shear-wave velocity profiles of the subsoil. Acquiring surface waves is a simple task, but the interpretation of their dispersion curves poses a number of challenges. In an increasing number of cases, shear-wave velocity profiles are derived from the inversion of dispersion curves of surface waves and single-station passive horizontal-to-vertical (H/V) spectral ratios, mostly using a blind joint fit of the two sets of curves. Here we emphasize the benefits of carrying out H/V surveys prior to any array acquisition. We propose to start by collecting at least two H/V recordings at a site to verify the 1D plane-parallel soil condition, as this is essential in dispersion curve inversion/modeling. Then, we look for the diagnostic features of velocity inversions in the H/V curves: when they occur, the interpretation of dispersion curves is made difficult by mode splitting/superposition and Love wave arrays will not be effective. Then we inspect the shape of the H/V curves: flat curves acquired on rock usually imply poor dispersion curves. Large receiver spacings are recommended in the arrays and Love wave arrays will not be efficient. Flat curves on soft material sites represent gently increasing [Formula: see text] gradients and Rayleigh wave arrays should be preferred. H/V curves with high frequency peaks indicate shallow impedance contrasts: this makes Love wave arrays efficient for the soft layer characterization, but provide little information at depth. H/V curves with low frequency peaks indicate deep bedrock and their inversion can provide approximate [Formula: see text] profiles down to greater depths than from an array. Equipped with the information coming from accurate H/V observations, practitioners could make better-informed decisions about array acquisition geometries, source/surface wave types, and inversion strategies.},

The underground parts of a plant are rarely seen; indeed the root system is usually hidden from sight.

One reason for such an imbalance involves the difficulties in studying roots in their heterogeneous and opaque environment. Consequently, relatively little is known about the importance of roots in the soil and how soil physico-chemical properties and soil organisms are influenced by the presence of roots and vice versa. Roots are not merely a passive agent that grow in a challenging environment: roots are engaged in a tremendous number of interactions with soil, which change soil properties and enhance its biotic component.},

We found a good linear ln--ln fit between absorbing root surface area and basal area (or stem cross-sectional area at the root collar in seedlings) over a range of stem diameters from 0.5--55 cm. The absorbing root surface area also changed consistently with crown projected area and the root-accessed area (territory) of the tree. At the whole-tree level, absorbing root surface area reached about 70 times that of basal area and 40\% of crown projected area, or roughly 1/3 of the root-accessed area in Norway spruce (in this species, the ratio was relatively larger in small trees and smaller in large trees). The absorbing root surfaces of mechanically severed parts of Norway spruce root systems changed in about the same proportions as the geometrically determined parts of the severed root systems. These results are promising and support field applications of the method in biological and ecological studies.},

We applied proximal gamma-ray spectrometry to evaluate tropical landscape dynamics, pedogenesis and spatial distribution of radionuclides and selected soil attributes. This study was carried out in southeast Brazil, where 79 soil samples (0--20 cm) along transects were collected to perform physical-chemical analysis coupled with collection of surface gamma-ray spectrometric data, allowing the detection of the radionuclides uranium (U238), thorium (Th232), and potassium (K40). Additionally, we analyzed soils in four toposequences, with varying lithology, relief, and hydrology. The radionuclide concentrations in soils showed a direct relationship with the parent material composition, either rocks or sediments. Weathering degree and the geochemical behavior of each radionuclide determines its permanence or removal in soils. Denudation processes along the toposequences also influence the distribution of radionuclides. On one hand, the radionuclide contents of mature, weathered soils are closely associated with advanced pedogenesis, with a higher clay contents and argic horizon formation, whereas in younger, less weathered soils the parent material exerts a greater influence than pedogenesis. Uranium decreased with altitude, and showed greater mobility compared with thorium. Thorium presented a higher correlation with clay content, and the opposite with sand content. Potassium detection increased with soil cation exchange capacity (CEC) and clay content. Gamma-spectrometry detected significant variations in some segments along the toposequences, undetectable by conventional soil survey techniques. This may indicate changes from one soil class to another or the continuity of a particular soil class, demonstrating the potential of this tool in digital soil mapping, pedogeochemical, pedogeomorphological and pedogenesis processes studies.},

  abstract = {Choi and Kim [J. Colloid Interface Sci. 333 (2009) 672] proposed a new wall boundary condition for f-potential and surface charge density to describe the electrokinetic flow-induced currents in silica nanofluidic channels using the Poisson--Boltzmann (PB) model and the Poisson--Nernst--Planck (PNP) model. They showed that the results from the PNP model are in close agreement with the experimental data reported by van der Heyden et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 95 (2005) 116104]. In this paper, a theoretical model based on the PB model incorporating their proposed boundary condition is presented, which does not necessitate highly expensive computational effort. The results from our proposed model are shown to be in agreement with their numerical results of the PNP model. The present model also addresses the importance of the electrical resistance of reservoirs or the position of the electrodes for the measurement of the streaming current. Further, we point out that there is a misinterpretation in a comparison between their numerical results and those of van der Heyden et al.'s experiments. Finally, we conclude that the experimental data still cannot be predicted accurately by their proposed boundary condition and model, especially for the electrolyte concentration C0 {$<$} 10{\`A}3 M.},

The spatial variation in radioelement concentration re2ects, in general, the geochemical di7erences among the analysed rocks. Rocks of the ophiolitic complex clearly di7er in K, U, and Th concentrations from sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks. The lowest U concentration ({\textexclamdown} 0:5 ppm) was found in tectonic units mainly formed by rocks of ma:c composition. The average U concentration increases to 2.6 --4:1 ppm in shales of di7erent units and calc-schists, and it is highest (5:6 ppm) in the dolomitic rocks. Shales and phyllitic schists of pelagic origin show the highest Th concentrations. The expected radon exhalation from the decay of 226Ra within the 238U decay series is, consequently, lower in the ophiolitic rocks (0.7--2:2 Bq m-2 h-1) and higher in calc-schists and dolomites (18.4 --20:7 Bq m-2 h-1). The estimated radon 2ux is also signi:cant in shales and phyllites (15.1--18:4 Bq m-2 h-1). c{\copyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

A commercial silica is grafted with an ethylediamine derivative, N-[3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl]-ethylenediamine. From the Langmuir isotherms, maximum adsorption capacities of the grafted silica towards Pb(II) and Cu(II) are determined (0.184 mmol Pb(II) g{\`A}1 and 0.261 mmol Cu(II) g{\`A}1) and compared to those of non-modified silica (respectively, 0.019 and 0.036 mmol g{\`A}1). Four kinetic models, i.e., pseudo-first order, pseudo-second order, Langmuir and doubleexponential are applied to fit the experimental kinetic data. The kinetic parameters are determined which allow to calculate the theoretical metal uptake as a function of time. The results are discussed and indicate the best fit is obtained with the double-exponential model. A discussion on the adsorption mechanism with respect to the double-exponential model leads to two possible interpretations: the metal uptake may follow a diffusion-controlled mechanism or a two-site adsorption process.},

The unusual features observed experimentally in silica nanochannels are described successfully using a new theoretical framework. First, a simple and reliable physicochemical boundary condition at the interface between the channel surface and the solution is suggested. It accounts for the surface conduction effect through the Stern layer and the dependence of the surface charge on the salt concentration and pH, which were commonly neglected in previous studies. Second, the proposed boundary condition is then incorporated into the traditional Poisson--Boltzmann and Nernst--Planck models to complete the selfconsistent model. Model predictions are validated by comparison with experimental data. It is found that the direct numerical predictions of the concentration polarization and the induced potential or pressure field are possible, and these allow us to describe the dependence of currents on the solution properties in the nanofluidic channel more accurately than the models proposed in previous studies.},

Moreover, our experiments with synthetic data and real sensor dataset confirm the improvement of localization accuracy. The synthetic data generated in various situations reveal the important properties of localization with the off-centered GPS.

To examine how these methods can inform model-based evapotranspiration (ET) calculation under varying soil water conditions, we conducted a pilot-scale field study at an experimental maize plot with manipulated irrigation treatments. Our goal was to develop a workflow for (1) acquiring and inverting field electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) data, (2) correlating ERT to soil hydraulic properties, (3) spatially characterizing soil water stress that feeds into ET modeling (the FAO-56 model), and (4) evaluating the performance of ERT-based ET computation. Our results showed that ERT was able to capture decimeter-scale soil water content (SWC) dynamics from root water uptake and irrigation manipulation and the contrast of soil water stress between deficiently and fully irrigated maize. We also demonstrated the flexibility of using ERT to spatially integrate soil water stress in the soil volume of interest, which could be adjusted based on different crops and plot layouts. The integration of the ERT datasets into ET modeling provided insights into the spatial heterogeneity of the subsurface that has been challenging for point-based sensing, which can further our understanding of the hydraulic dynamics in the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum.           ,              Core Ideas                                                                Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) captured soil water dynamics induced by root water uptake and irrigation manipulation.

The aim of this research is to provide some evidence about the effectiveness of a hydrogeochemical geodatabase to facilitate the integrated management, representation and analysis of heterogeneous data, enabling the appropriate selection, design and optimization of an effective remediation strategy. This study investigates a new technology for the remediation of a dense non-aqueous phase liquid aged source zone, with the aim of enhancing in situ bioremediation by coupling groundwater circulation wells with a continuous production system of electron donors. The technology was verified through a pilot test carried out at an industrial site highly contaminated by chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons. The multidisciplinary conceptual model confirmed a complex hydrogeological situation, with the occurrence of active residual sources in low permeability layers. The pilot test results clearly demonstrate a significant mobilization of contaminants from the low permeability zone, and the possibility of favoring the in situ natural attenuation mechanisms based upon biological reductive dechlorination. Different information related to the hydrogeochemical sphere must be integrated and taken into consideration when developing a reliable remediation strategy for contaminated sites.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The remediation of petroleum-contaminated soil and groundwater is a challenging task. The petroleum hydrocarbons have a long persistence in both the vadose zone and in the aquifer and potentially represent secondary and residual sources of contamination. This is particularly evident in the presence of residual free-phase. Pump-and-treat is the most common hydrocarbon decontamination strategy. Besides, it acts primarily on the water dissolved phase and reduces concentrations of contaminants to an asymptotic trend. This study presents a case of enhanced light non-aqueous phase liquid (LNAPL) remediation monitored using noninvasive techniques. A pilot-scale field experiment was conducted through the injection of reagents into the subsoil to stimulate the desorption and the oxidation of residual hydrocarbons. Geophysical and groundwater monitoring during pilot testing controlled the effectiveness of the intervention, both in terms of product diffusion capacity and in terms of effective reduction of pollutant concentrations. In particular, non-invasive monitoring of the reagent migration and its capability to reach the target areas is a major add-on to the remediation technique. Most of the organic contaminants were decomposed, mobilized, and subsequently removed using physical recovery techniques. A considerable mass of contaminant was recovered resulting in the reduction of concentrations in the intervention areas.},

  abstract = {Contaminated sites are complex systems posing challenges for their characterization as both contaminant dis\- tribution and hydrogeological properties vary markedly at the metric scale, yet may extend over broad areas, with serious issues of spatial under-sampling in the space. Characterization with sufficient spatial resolution is thus, one of the main concerns and still open areas of research. To this end, the joint use of direct and indirect (i. e., geophysical) investigation methods is a very promising approach. This paper presents a case study aspiring to demonstrate the benefit of a multidisciplinary approach in the characterization of a hydrocarbon-contaminated site. Detailed multi-source data, collected via stratigraphic boreholes, laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) surveys, electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) prospecting, groundwater hydrochemical monitoring, and gas chroma\- tography--mass spectrometry (GC--MS) analyses were compiled into an interactive big-data package for modeling activities. The final product is a comprehensive conceptual hydro-geophysical model overlapping multi-modality data and capturing hydrogeological and geophysical structures, as well as contamination distribution in space and dynamics in time. The convergence of knowledge in the joint model verifies the possibility of discriminating geophysical findings based on lithological features and contamination effects, unmasking the real characteristics of the pollutant, the contamination mechanisms, and the residual phase hydrocarbon sequestration linked to the hydrogeological dynamics and adopted remediation actions. The emerging conceptual site model (CSM), emphasizing the necessity of a large amount of multi-source data for its reliable, high-resolution reconstruction, appears as the necessary tool for the design of remedial actions, as well as for the monitoring of remediation performance.},

  abstract = {Most studies on measures of transpiration of plants, especially woody fruit, relies on methods of heat supply in the trunk. This study aimed to calibrate the Thermal Dissipation Probe Method (TDP) to estimate the transpiration, study the effects of natural thermal gradients and determine the relation between outside diameter and area of xylem in 'Valencia' orange young plants. TDP were installed in 40 orange plants of 15 months old, planted in boxes of 500 L, in a greenhouse. It was tested the correction of the natural thermal differences (DTN) for the estimation based on two unheated probes. The area of the conductive section was related to the outside diameter of the stem by means of polynomial regression. The equation for estimation of sap flow was calibrated having as standard lysimeter measures of a representative plant. The angular coefficient of the equation for estimating sap flow was adjusted by minimizing the absolute deviation between the sap flow and daily transpiration measured by lysimeter. Based on these results, it was concluded that the method of TDP, adjusting the original calibration and correction of the DTN, was effective in transpiration assessment.           ,              Grande parte dos estudos sobre medidas de transpira{\c c}{\~a}o de plantas, principalmente em frut{\'i}feras lenhosas, baseia-se em m{\'e}todos de fornecimento de calor ao tronco.

At each frequency the resting cell was balanced in a Wheatstone bridge with a cathode ray oscillograph, and after electrical stimulation at one end of the cell, the changes in the complex impedance were determined from the bridge unbalance recorded by motion pictures of the oscillograph figure. An extension of the previous technique of interpretation of the transverse impedance shows that the normal membrane capacity of 0.9 {\textmu}f./cm.2 decreases about 15 per cent without change of phase angle, while the membrane resistance decreases from 105 ohm cm.2 to about 500 ohm cm.2 during the passage of the excitation wave. This membrane change occurs during the latter part of the rising phase of the action potential, and it is shown that the membrane electromotive force remains unchanged until nearly the same time. The part of the action potential preceding these membrane changes is probably a passive fall of potential ahead of a partial short circuit.},

To this aim, new and more reliable methods for vineyard monitoring purposes must be defined. The introduction of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) airborne sensors makes available a considerable amount of data with very high resolution, in terms of both spatial and temporal dimension. In this work, a data fusion approach for vigour characterization in vineyards is presented, which exploits the information provided by 2D multispectral aerial imagery, 3D point cloud crop models and aerial thermal imagery. A crucial phase of the procedure is the proper management of data provided by several sources, to achieve high consistency of the obtained huge dataset. The enhanced effectiveness of the proposed method to classify vines in different vigour classes exploiting multi source data was proved by an experimental campaign, considering 30 portions of vine rows, each made by 8 vines. Results showed that the error of the discriminant analysis using data fusion reach an improvement ranging from 67\% to 90\% with respect to a single data source, with a misclassification error rate of 3\%.},

The objectives of this study were to (1) calibrate and validate these sensors in mineral soils, (2) determine the sensing volume of each sensor, and (3) evaluate the temperature sensitivity of the sensors. Both sensors were calibrated in the laboratory using columns of packed soil at multiple moisture levels from air-dry to near saturation. Sensors were validated using additional laboratory and field measurements. The sensing volume was determined by quantifying the response of raw sensor outputs while increasing the level of oven-dry sand, moist sand (0.100 cm3 cm-3), or water around the sensor in the radial and axial directions. Temperature sensitivity was tested in controlled conditions over a range of temperatures from 2{\r{}}C to 40{\r{}}C using encapsulated sensors in packed soil columns at constant {$\thetav$}. Linear calibration models resulted in mean absolute error {$\leq$}0.030 cm3 cm-3 for both sensors during laboratory and field validations. In moist sand, the sensing volume contributing 95\% of the maximum sensor response was 439 cm3 for the TEROS 10 and 423 cm3 for the TEROS 12. Both sensors exhibited changes in {$\thetav$} of {$\leq$}0.02 cm3 cm-3 when subjected to a temperature change from 2{\r{}}C to 40{\r{}}C. For the soils considered here, both sensors demonstrated accuracy that is likely sufficient for a variety of agricultural and hydrological applications.},

This study analyzes the impact of aquifer characterization on land energy fluxes, using a coupled hydrology--landsurface model. Four gridded subsurface conductivity fields are developed for the Upper Klamath basin using two data sources and different levels of imposed heterogeneity. Each model is forced with the same transient, observed meteorology for 3 years prior to the final year presented here. Results are analyzed to quantify the impact of subsurface heterogeneity on groundwater surface water interactions and spatial patterns in hydrologic variables. Analysis shows that heterogeneity does not fundamentally alter the connection between groundwater and land surface processes. However, differences between scenarios impact the extent and location of the critical zone.},

  abstract = {We investigate the thermal dependence of the complex conductivity of nine porous materials in the temperature range +20 {$^\circ$}C to -10 or -15 {$^\circ$}C. The selected samples include three soils, two granites, three clay-sands mixes, and one graphitic tight sandstone. A total of 12 experiments is conducted with one sample tested at three different salinities. Our goal is to use this database to extend the dynamic Stern layer polarization model in freezing conditions. We observe two polarization mechanisms, one associated with the effect of the change in the liquid water content and its salinity upon the polarization of the porous material. A second mechanism, at higher frequencies ({$>$}10 Hz), is likely associated with the polarization of ice. At low frequencies and above the freezing point, the in-phase and quadrature conductivities depend on temperature in a predictable way. This dependence is due to the dependence of the mobility of the charge carriers with temperature. Below the freezing point, the in-phase and quadrature conductivity follow a brutal decay with temperature. This dependence is modeled through an exponential freezing curve function. We were also able to determine how the (apparent) formation factor and surface conductivity change with temperature and water content below the freezing point. Our model is able to replicate the data at low frequencies and predicts correctly the fact that the ratio between the normalized chargeability and the surface conductivity is independent of the water content and temperature and equals a well-defined dimensionless number R.},

  abstract = {The retention and availability of water in the soil vary according to the soil characteristics and determine plant growth. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate water retention and availability in the soils of the State of Santa Catarina, Brazil, according to the textural class, soil class and lithology. The surface and subsurface horizons of 44 profiles were sampled in different regions of the State and different cover crops to determine field capacity, permanent wilting point, available water content, particle size, and organic matter content. Water retention and availability between the horizons were compared in a mixed model, considering the textural classes, the soil classes and lithology as fixed factors and profiles as random factors. It may be concluded that water retention is greater in silty or clayey soils and that the organic matter content is higher, especially in Humic Cambisols, Nitisols and Ferralsol developed from igneous or sedimentary rocks. Water availability is greater in loam-textured soils, with high organic matter content, especially in soils of humic character. It is lower in the sandy texture class, especially in Arenosols formed from recent alluvial deposits or in gravelly soils derived from granite. The greater water availability in the surface horizons, with more organic matter than in the subsurface layers, illustrates the importance of organic matter for water retention and availability.},

In this study the competitive sorption and desorption of Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn by humified organic matter, Fe and Mn oxides, kaolinite, vermiculite and mica were investigated. Due to the homogeneity of the sorbents, between-metal competition for binding sites led to their preferences for one or another metal being much more manifest than in the case of whole soils. On the basis of kd100 values (distribution coefficients calculated in sorption--desorption experiments in which the initial sorption solution contained 100 mg L-1 of each metal), kaolinite and mica preferentially sorbed and retained chromium; vermiculite, copper and zinc; HOM, Fe oxide and Mn oxide, lead (HOM and Mn oxide also sorbed and retained considerable amounts of copper). Mica only retained sorbed chromium, Fe oxide sorbed cadmium and lead, and kaolinite did not retain sorbed copper. The sorbents retaining the greatest proportions of sorbed metals were vermiculite and Mn oxide, but the ratios of kd100 values for retention and sorption suggest that cations were least reversibly bound by Mn oxide, and most reversibly by vermiculite.},

Growing evidence suggests that in syntrophic communities electron transfer does not rely exclusively on the exchange of diffusible molecules and energy carriers such as hydrogen or formate, rather microorganisms have the capability to exchange metabolic electrons in a more direct manner. Here, we show that supplementation of micrometer-size magnetite (Fe3O4) particles to a methanogenic sludge enhanced (up to 33\%) the methane production rate from propionate, a key intermediate in the anaerobic digestion of organic matter and a model substrate to study energy-limited syntrophic communities. The stimulatory effect most probably resulted from the establishment of a direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET), based on magnetite particles serving as electron conduits between propionate-oxidizing acetogens and carbon dioxide-reducing methanogens. Theoretical calculations revealed that DIET allows electrons to be transferred among syntrophic partners at rates which are substantially higher than those attainable via interspecies H2 transfer. Besides the remarkable potential for improving anaerobic digestion, which is a proven biological strategy for renewable energy production, the herein described conduction-based DIET could also have a role in natural methane emissions from magnetite-rich soils and sediments.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Microbial electrochemical technologies (METs) represent a novel platform to harvest the energy trapped in municipal wastewater. At the anode of METs, electro-active bacteria (EAB) anaerobically oxidize wastewater constituents using the electrode as the terminal electron acceptor and, by so doing, generate an electric current. To convert complex wastewater constituents into electricity, EAB must not only establish syntrophic relationships with other members of the microbial community, but also compete with methanogens for consumption of hydrogen and acetate. Here, we examined the addition of magnetite nanoparticles (NPs) (250 mg Fe L-1) as a novel strategy to manipulate such metabolic interactions and in turn maximize the efficiency of wastewater treatment and the yield of electric current generation. RESULTS: Batch experiments carried out either in the presence of a mixture of volatile fatty acids or of a synthetic sewage demonstrated that magnetite addition accelerate the rate of electrogenic oxidation of specific compounds, particularly propionate (up to 120\%), an intermediate which frequently accumulates during anaerobic treatment processes, while correspondingly enhancing electric current generation (up to 90\%), and diminishing the rate of competing methane generation (up to 50\%). Notably, the composition of the microbial community was not substantially affected by the presence of magnetite nanoparticles, possibly suggesting that these latter facilitated extracellular electron transfer mechanisms (among microbes and with the electrode), rather than enriching conditions for specific microorganisms. CONCLUSION: The addition of magnetite NPs may represent a practical strategy to kick-start a bioelectrochemical system designed for wastewater treatment and improve the effectiveness of electrogenic substrate oxidation processes. {\copyright} 2019 Society of Chemical Industry},

  abstract = {Anaerobic bioremediation is a relevant process in the management of sites contaminated by petroleum hydrocarbons. Recently, interspecies electron transfer processes mediated by conductive minerals or particles have been proposed as mechanisms through which microbial species within a community share reducing equivalents to drive the syntrophic degradation of organic substrates, including hydrocarbons. Here, a microcosm study was set up to investigate the effect of different electrically conductive materials (ECMs) in enhancing the anaerobic biodegradation of hydrocarbons in historically contaminated soil. The results of a comprehensive suite of chemical and microbiological analyses evidenced that supplementing the soil with (5\% w/w) magnetite nanoparticles or biochar particles is an effective strategy to accelerate the removal of selected hydrocarbons. In particular, in microcosms supplemented with ECMs, the removal of total petroleum hydrocarbons was enhanced by up to 50\% relative to unamended controls. However, chemical analyses suggested that only a partial bioconversion of contaminants occurred and that longer treatment times would have probably been required to drive the biodegradation process to completion. On the other hand, biomolecular analyses confirmed the presence of several microorganisms and functional genes likely involved in hydrocarbon degradation. Furthermore, the selective enrichment of known electroactive bacteria (i.e., Geobacter and Geothrix) in microcosms amended with ECMs, clearly pointed to a possible role of DIET (Diet Interspecies Electron Transfer) processes in the observed removal of contaminants.},

Electrical impedance, phase angle (strength of capacitive character), and dissipation factor in the plant-soil system were scanned between 100 and 10 000 Hz current frequency. The frequency-dependent change in the phase angle could be described by optimum curves culminating within 920-3 650 Hz. Since the rate of energy dissipation is independent of root extent, the higher phase angle and lower energy dissipation were associated with the higher coefficient of determination achieved for the root electrical impedance - root system size (root dry mass and root surface area) regressions. The characteristic frequency selected on the basis of phase angle spectra provided a higher significance level at statistical comparison of plant groups subjected to stress conditions influencing root development. Due to the physicochemical changes observable in aging root tissue, the apex of phase angle spectra, thus the characteristic frequency, shifted continuously toward the higher frequencies over time. Consequently, the regularly repeated phase angle measurement is advisable in time-course studies for effective application of the electrical impedance method, and the systematic operation at the same frequency without determination of phase angle spectra should be avoided.}

This study aimed to adapt the method for field monitoring by evaluating the effect of SWC on root capacitance to ensure the comparability of CR detected at different SWC. First a pot experiment was conducted with maize and soybean to establish CR--SWC functions for the field soil. Ontogenetic changes in root activity were monitored under field conditions by simultaneously measuring CR and SWC around the roots. The CR values were normalized using SWC data and experimental CR--SWC functions to obtain CR{$\ast$}, the comparable indicator of root activity. The effect of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) inoculation on the CR{$\ast$} and biomass of field-grown soybean was investigated. The pot trial showed an exponential increase in CR with SWC. CR--SWC functions proved to be species-specific. CR showed strong correlation with root dry mass (R2 = 0.83--0.87). The root activity (CR{$\ast$}) of field-grown crops increased until flowering, then decreased during maturity. This was consistent with data obtained with other methods. AMF inoculation of soybean resulted in significantly higher CR{$\ast$} during the late vegetative and early flowering stages, when destructive sampling concurrently showed higher shoot biomass. The results demonstrated that the root capacitance method could be useful for time course studies on root activity under field conditions, and for comparing single-time capacitance data collected in areas with heterogeneous soil water status.},

An `electrode separation experiment' and a `root excision experiment' were performed on potted maize plants cultivated in arenosol. The partial electrical separation of the ground electrode (restriction of the current flow in the topsoil) caused no significant changes in the capacitance and impedance of either the soil or the plant--soil system. This suggested that the current flows through a multitude of soil solution pathways, not predominantly on the wet soil surface. The progressive excision of the main root branches caused a gradual decrease in               C                                R                              (31--39\% of the initial value) and an increase in               Z                                R                              (4.4- to 5.2-fold that of intact plants).

The closeness of the latter relationship decreased further (               R               2               \,=\,0.377) after whole root excision. The results clearly demonstrated that the root system dominated the measured capacitance and impedance, though the role of the stem base was not negligible. In conclusion, the capacitance method is worth considering in future studies as an adequate non-intrusive approach to evaluate root size in the soil.},

On 29 October 2018, an exceptional sea storm event (the Adrian storm) occurred in the Ligurian Sea (NW Mediterranean Sea), producing severe damage to coastal constructions and infrastructures. However, the microseism measured at seismic stations located near the coast did not show equivalent high energy, thus resulting in a severe underestimation of the Hs predicted. In the present study, the Adrian storm was compared to other sea storms that have occurred in the Ligurian Sea in recent decades. The aim of this paper is to statistically examine the distinctive peculiarities of the Adrian storm in order to find new parameters to insert in the empirical models used in the procedure recently implemented for monitoring of Hs through microseism recordings in the Ligurian Sea, improving the effectiveness in Hs estimates in cases of extreme events that do not produce high-energy microseisms. The results show that the additional parameters to be taken into account into the predictive model are the atmospheric pressure gradient and the wind intensity. A correction term is finally proposed and applied to the predictive model to significantly reduce the Hs underestimation.},

Here we focus on the order of magnitude of the advection term in the equation of the evolution of temperature as generated by documented terrain heterogeneities and we estimate its importance as a term in the surface energy budget (SEB), for which the turbulent fluxes are computed using the eddycorrelation method. The heterogeneities are estimated from satellite and model fields for scales near 1 km or broader, while the smaller scales are estimated through direct measurements with remotely piloted aircraft and thermal cameras and also by high-resolution modelling. The variability of the surface temperature fields is not found to decrease clearly with increasing resolution, and consequently the advection term becomes more important as the scales become finer. The advection term provides non-significant values to the SEB at scales larger than a few kilometres. In contrast, surface heterogeneities at the metre scale yield large values of the advection, which are probably only significant in the first centimetres above the ground. The motions that seem to contribute significantly to the advection term in the SEB equation in our case are roughly those around the hectometre scales.},

  abstract = {Coincident monitoring of the spatiotemporal distribution of and interactions between land, soil, and permafrost properties is important for advancing our understanding of ecosystem dynamics. In this study, a novel monitoring strategy was developed to quantify complex Arctic ecosystem responses to the seasonal freeze-thaw-growing season conditions. The strategy exploited autonomous measurements obtained through electrical resistivity tomography to monitor soil properties, pole-mounted optical cameras to monitor vegetation dynamics, point probes to measure soil temperature, and periodic manual measurements of thaw layer thickness, snow thickness, and soil dielectric permittivity. The spatially and temporally dense monitoring data sets revealed several insights about tundra system behavior at a site located near Barrow, AK. In the active layer, the soil electrical conductivity (a proxy for soil water content) indicated an increasing positive correlation with the green chromatic coordinate (a proxy for vegetation vigor) over the growing season, with the strongest correlation (R = 0.89) near the typical peak of the growing season. Soil conductivity and green chromatic coordinate also showed significant positive correlations with thaw depth, which is influenced by soil and surface properties. In the permafrost, soil electrical conductivity revealed annual variations in solute concentration and unfrozen water content, even at temperatures well below 0{$^\circ$}C in saline permafrost. These conditions may contribute to an acceleration of long-term thaw in Coastal permafrost regions. Demonstration of this first aboveground and belowground geophysical monitoring approach within an Arctic ecosystem illustrates its significant potential to remotely ``visualize'' permafrost, soil, and vegetation ecosystem codynamics in high resolution over field relevant scales.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Measuring soil and snow temperature with high vertical and lateral resolution is critical for advancing the predictive understanding of thermal and hydro-biogeochemical processes that govern the behavior of environmental systems. Vertically resolved soil temperature measurements enable the estimation of soil thermal regimes, frozen-/thawed-layer thickness, thermal parameters, and heat and/or water fluxes. Similarly, they can be used to capture the snow depth and the snowpack thermal parameters and fluxes. However, these measurements are challenging to acquire using conventional approaches due to their total cost, their limited vertical resolution, and their large installation footprint. This study presents the development and validation of a novel distributed temperature profiling (DTP) system that addresses these challenges. The system leverages digital temperature sensors to provide unprecedented, finely resolved depth profiles of temperature measurements with flexibility in system geometry and vertical resolution. The integrated miniaturized logger enables automated data acquisition, management, and wireless transfer. A novel calibration approach adapted to the DTP system confirms the factory-assured sensor accuracy of {\textpm}0.1\,{$\circ$}C and enables improving it to {\textpm}0.015\,{$\circ$}C. Numerical experiments indicate that, under normal environmental conditions, an additional error of 0.01\,\% in amplitude and 70\,s time delay in amplitude for a diurnal period can be expected, owing to the DTP housing. We demonstrate the DTP systems capability at two field sites, one focused on understanding how snow dynamics influence mountainous water resources and the other focused on understanding how soil properties influence carbon cycling. Results indicate that the DTP system reliably captures the dynamics in snow depth and soil freezing and thawing depth, enabling advances in understanding the intensity and timing in surface processes and their impact on subsurface thermohydrological regimes. Overall, the DTP system fulfills the needs for data accuracy, minimal power consumption, and low total cost, enabling advances in the multiscale understanding of various cryospheric and hydro-biogeochemical processes.},

  abstract = {Multi-electrode geoelectrical imaging has become very popular and is used for many different purposes. For some of these, the inclusion of IP data would be desirable as it would allow the interpreter to distinguish between, e.g. sand formations with saltwater infiltration and clay formations or help delineate landfills. However, present-day IP measuring techniques require the use of nonpolarisable potential electrodes and special wire layout and are thus cumbersome and expensive. In this paper, we suggest making IP measurements with multi-electrode cables and just one set of steel electrodes. The polarisation potentials on the potential electrodes are corrected for by subtracting the polarisation potential measured when no primary current and no IP signal are present. Test measurements indicate that the polarisation potentials vary slowly and that the correction procedure is feasible. At two sites in southern Sweden, we have compared measurements with only stainless steel electrodes and measurements with both stainless steel and Pb -- PbCl nonpolarisable electrodes using one or two sets of multicore cables, respectively. Almost no difference between the two data sets was observed. At one site, the charge-up effect on the potential electrodes was not important, while at the other site, the correction procedure was crucial. Though only two sites have been studied so far, it seems that time-domain IP imaging measurements can be taken with only steel electrodes and ordinary multicore cables. Coupling in the multicore cables has not presented any problems at the investigated sites where grounding resistances were moderate, making the coupling effect small. High grounding resistance sites have not yet been investigated. D 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

We have developed an ERT algorithm that is an iterative, modified least squares inversion, based on a finite element forward solution of Laplace's equation. We report the results of tests on this algorithm designed to determine how resistance measurements made from two boreholes may be used to image the resistivity distribution between them. A number of simple but geophysically significant structures are modeled. These include a single isolated block anomaly, two layers, a thin isolated continuous layer, and a vertical band. The main features of most resistivity models were identifiable in the reconstructions. Limited data accuracy and noise were simulated and found to cause a deterioration of the image. However, even with measurements of only one significant figure accuracy, the algorithm converged toward the desired solution for at least the first iteration and the targets were identifiable in the reconstructions. Imprecision in the data influences convergence as well as image quality; more iterations eventually lead to divergence. Spatial resolution depends on such factors as data errors and the specific target geometry.},

  abstract = {Cross borehole electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) was used to image the resistivity distribution before and during two infiltration experiments. In both cases water was introduced into the vadose zone, and the change in resistivity associated with the plume of wetted soil was imaged as a function of time. The primary purpose of this work was to study the capabilities and limitations of ERT to image underground structure and ground water movement in the vadose zone. A secondary goal was to learn specifics of unsaturated flow in a complex geologic setting. Tomographs of electrical resistivity taken before infiltration image coarser, well-drained soils (sands and gravels) as more resistive zones, whereas finer grained soils (silts and clays), which hold more water by capillarity, are imaged as more conductive. Images of changes in resistivity during infiltration show growth of the water infiltration plume with time that is consistent with known geology. In the ERT images we see the effects of capillary barriers and infer differences between capillary-driven flow through fine sediments and gravity-driven flow through very permeable sediments. Images are consistent with numerical flow simulations using hydrological parameter values consistent with soil types inferred from well logs. ERT can be a useful tool to monitor movement of circuitous moisture fronts in a heterogeneous field setting that would go undetected by borehole measurements.},

A system was developed for the experiment to allow remote operation during the entire test. Approximately [Formula: see text] of concentrated sodium thiosulfate (simulating tank waste) were episodically released from a steel tank in a blind test lasting [Formula: see text] (no knowledge of the release episodes during the course of the test were provided). ERT data were collected using an array of point electrodes installed in boreholes around the tank. Each day during the test a leak or no-leak condition was declared based solely on analysis of the electrical data. The success rate of the declarations made during the test was only 57\%, however, further analysis carried out at the end of the test resulted in a significant improvement of the success rate.

Stage of development studies showed plant root capacitance measurements capable of detecting root development rate and suggested the method to be sensitive to root function. Soil water content was shown to have a significant effect on plant root capacitance measurement. The possibility of using this technique to assess relative root function is discussed. Positioning of the plant shoot electrode was shown to also have a significant effect on measurement of plant root capacitance, demonstrating the need for using consistent measurement techniques.

Grape trunk diseases and viruses are some of the most frequently identified causes of vine dieback. However, a decline is sometimes observed when no mineral deficiency or excess, or pathogenic causes can be identified. Soil enzymatic and microbial activities are relevant bio-indicators since they are known to influence vine health. Grapevine associated microbiota, linked to vine fitness, is known to be influenced by soil microbiota coming from the microbial pool inhabiting the vineyard. This work describes the microbial diversity and activity of four different vineyard plots of the Bordeaux region, selected due to the presence of localised declining areas unexplained yet by disease symptoms. Soils were sampled in declining areas and areas within the same plot showing no decline symptoms, during autumn and spring periods. Significant differences in enzymatic activities, microbial biomass and activity were found among soils even if those soils presented quite similar physicochemical characteristics that could not explain these observed declines. The results of enzymatic assays distinguished patterns in autumn and spring periods with an overall greater enzymatic activity in soils from non-declining areas. This work suggests that soils displaying decline symptoms present a dysbiosis in functionality and diversity which is linked to vine health.},

  abstract = {The objective of this study was to investigate the electrical impedance properties of rat lung and other tissues ex vivo using Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy. Rat lungs (both electroporated and na{\"i}ve (untreated)), and mesenteric vessels (na{\"i}ve) were harvested from male Sprague-Dawley rats; their electrical impedance were measured using a Solartron 1290 impedance analyzer. Mouse lung and heart samples (na{\"i}ve) were also studied. The resistance (Real Z, ohm) and the reactance (Im Z, negative ohm)) magnitudes and hence the Cole-Cole (Real Z versus Im Z) plots are different for the electroporated lung and the naive lung. The results confirm the close relationship between the structure and the functional characteristic. These also vary for the different biological tissues studied. The impedance values were higher at low frequencies compared to those at high frequencies. This study is of practical interest for biological applications of electrical pulses, such as electroporation, whose efficacy depends on cell type and its electrical impedance characteristics.},

  abstract = {Electrical resistivity methods are widely used for environmental applications, and they are particularly useful for the characterization and monitoring of sites where the presence of contamination requires a thorough understanding of the location and movement of water, that can act as a carrier of solutes. One such application is landfill studies, where the strong electrical contrasts between waste, leachate and surrounding formations make electrical methods a nearly ideal tool for investigation. In spite of the advantages, however, electrical investigation of landfills poses also challenges, both logistical and interpretational. This paper presents the results of a study conducted on a dismissed landfill, close to the city of Corigliano d'Otranto, in the Apulia region (Southern Italy). The landfill is located in an abandoned quarry, that was subsequently re-utilized about thirty years ago as a site for urban waste disposal. The waste was thought to be more than 20 m thick, and the landfill bottom was expected to be confined with an HDPE (high-density poli-ethylene) liner. During the digging operations performed to build a nearby new landfill, leachate was found, triggering an in-depth investigation including also non-invasive methods. The principal goal was to verify whether the leachate is indeed confined, and to what extent, by the HDPE liner. We performed both surface electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and mise-{\`a}-la-masse (MALM) surveys, facing the severe challenges posed by the rugged terrain of the abandoned quarry complex. A conductive body, probably associated with leachate, was found as deep as 40 m below the current landfill surface i.e. at a depth much larger than the expected 20 m thickness of waste. Given the logistical difficulties that limit the geometry of acquisition, we utilized synthetic forward modeling in order to confirm/dismiss interpretational hypotheses emerging from the ERT and MALM results. This integration between measurements and modeling helped narrow the alternative interpretations and strengthened the confidence in results, confirming the effectiveness of non-invasive methods in landfill investigation and the importance of modeling in the interpretation of geophysical results.},

In one of these trenches, located upstream, seasonal variations in the infiltration rate were observed, with a lower infiltration rate during summer than in winter. This effect could be due to the occurrence of a bioclogging phenomenon in the warm season. In addition, time-lapse electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) was carried out in two different periods, corresponding to the wet and dry seasons, in order to investigate the infiltration process dynamics below the bottom of the trench. Remarkable variability was observed between the south and north sides of the trench---clearly related to the local-scale heterogeneity of the rock formation of the trenches. The results suggest that such an integrated approach should be considered of great interest in case of using infiltration trenches as managed aquifer recharge (MAR) plants. This methodology could provide useful information about the heterogeneities of the rock formation, supporting an alert system for the identification of clogging effects during the life cycle of the plant.},

Here, we show a novel reactor design based on capacitive granules: the fluidized capacitive bioanode. Activated carbon (AC) granules are colonized by electrochemically active microorganisms, which extract electrons from acetate and store the electrons in the granule. Electricity is harvested from the AC granules in an external discharge cell. We show a proof-of-principle of the fluidized capacitive system with a total anode volume of 2 L. After a start-up period of 100 days, the current increased from 0.56 A/m2 with 100 g AC granules, to 0.99 A/m2 with 150 g AC granules, to 1.3 A/m2 with 200 g AC granules. Contact between moving AC granules and current collector was confirmed in a control experiment without biofilm. Contribution of an electro-active biofilm to the current density with recirculation of AC granules was limited. SEM images confirmed that a biofilm was present on the AC granules after operation in the fluidized capacitive system. Although current densities reported here need further improvement, the high surface area of the AC granules in combination with external discharge offers new and promising opportunities for scaling up MFCs.},

It extends and complements an existing open-source package for EMI data inversion, and includes an interactive graphical user interface. Its use is explained by a theoretical introduction and demonstrated through a simulated case study. The nonlinear data inversion issue is briefly discussed and the inversion module of the package is extended by a new regularized minimal-norm algorithm.},

  abstract = {Urban stormwater may contain a variety of pollutants, including viruses and other pathogens, and contaminants of emerging concern (pharmaceuticals, artificial sweeteners, and personal care products). In vulnerable geologic settings, the potential exists for these contaminants to reach underlying aquifers and contaminate drinking water wells. Viruses and other pathogens, as well as other contaminants of emerging concern, were measured in stormwater and groundwater at an urban site containing a stormwater cistern and related subsurface infiltration gallery, three shallow lysimeter wells, and a monitoring well. Five of 12 microbial targets were detected more than once across the eight rounds of sampling and at multiple sampling points, with human-specific Bacteroides detected most frequently. The microbial and chemical contaminants present in urban stormwater were much lower in the water table monitoring well than the vadose zone lysimeters. There may be numerous causes for these reductions, but they are most likely related to transit across fine-grained sediments that separate the water table from the vadose zone at this location. Precipitation amount prior to sample collection was significantly associated with microbial load. A significant relation between microbial load and chloride-bromide ratio was also observed. The reduction in number and concentrations of contaminants found in the monitoring well indicates that although geologically sensitive aquifers receiving urban stormwater effluent in the subsurface may be prone to contamination, those with a protective cap of fine-grained sediments are less vulnerable. These results can inform stormwater infiltration guidance relative to drinking water wells, with an emphasis on restricting infiltration near water supply wells finished in geologically sensitive aquifers to reduce public health risks.},

  abstract = {Heterogeneity can be dealt with by defining homogeneous equivalent properties, known as averaging, or by trying to describe the spatial variability of the rock properties from geologic observations and local measurements. The techniques available for these descriptions are mostly continuous Geostatistical models, or discontinuous facies models such as the Boolean, Indicator or Gaussian-Threshold models and the Markov chain model. These facies models are better suited to treating issues of rock strata connectivity, e.g. buried high permeability channels or low permeability barriers, which greatly affect flow and, above all, transport in aquifers. Genetic models provide new ways to incorporate more geology into the facies description, an approach that has been well developed in the oil industry, but not enough in hydrogeology. The conclusion is that future work should be focused on improving the facies models, comparing them, and designing new in situ testing procedures (including geophysics) that would help identify the facies geometry and properties. A world-wide catalog of aquifer facies geometry and properties, which could combine site genesis and description with methods used to assess the system, would be of great value for practical applications.},

Here, we provide a critical perspective on published studies of MP ingestion by aquatic biota. We summarize the available research on MP presence, behaviour and effects on aquatic organisms monitored in the field and on laboratory studies of the ecotoxicological consequences of MP ingestion. We consider MP polymer type, shape, size as well as group of organisms studied and type of effect reported. Specifically, we evaluate whether or not the available laboratory studies of MP are representative of the types of MPs found in the environment and whether or not they have reported on relevant groups or organisms. Analysis of the available data revealed that 1) despite their widespread detection in field-based studies, polypropylene, polyester and polyamide particles were under-represented in laboratory studies; 2) fibres and fragments (800--1600 {$\mu$}m) are the most common form of MPs reported in animals collected from the field; 3) to date, most studies have been conducted on fish; knowledge is needed about the effects of MPs on other groups of organisms, especially invertebrates. Furthermore, there are significant mismatches between the types of MP most commonly found in the environment or reported in field studies and those used in laboratory experiments. Finally, there is an overarching need to understand the mechanism of action and ecotoxicological effects of environmentally relevant concentrations of MPs on aquatic organism health.},

These ``background'' neutrons respond strongly to the presence of water at or near the land surface and represent a hitherto elusive intermediate spatial scale of observation that is ideal for land surface studies and modeling. Soil moisture, snow, and biomass each have a distinct influence on the spectrum, height profile, and directional intensity of neutron fluxes above the ground, suggesting that different sources of water at the land surface can be distinguished with neutron data alone. Measurements can be taken at fixed sites for long-term monitoring or in a moving vehicle for mapping over large areas. We anticipate applications in many previously problematic contexts, including saline environments, wetlands and peat bogs, rocky soils, the active layer of permafrost, and water and snow intercepted by vegetation, as well as calibration and validation of data from spaceborne sensors.},

Recently important efforts to more fully integrate the management of floods and water resources have begun, with the aim of benefitting both sectors. California is shown here to experience unusually large variations in annual precipitation and streamflow totals relative to the rest of the US, variations which mostly reflect the unusually small average number of wet days per year needed to accumulate most of its annual precipitation totals (ranging from 5 to 15 days in California). Thus whether just a few large storms arrive or fail to arrive in California can be the difference between a banner year and a drought. Furthermore California receives some of the largest 3-day storm totals in the country, rivaling in this regard the hurricane belt of the southeastern US. California's largest storms are generally fueled by landfalling atmospheric rivers (ARs). The fractions of precipitation and streamflow totals at stations across the US that are associated with ARs are documented here and, in California, contribute 20--50\% of the state's precipitation and streamflow. Prospects for long-lead forecasts of these fractions are presented. From a meteorological perspective, California's water resources and floods are shown to derive from the same storms to an extent that makes integrated flood and water resources management all the more important.},

  abstract = {The western United States is a region long defined by water challenges. Climate change adds to those historical challenges, but does not, for the most part, introduce entirely new challenges; rather climate change is likely to stress water supplies and resources already in many cases stretched to, or beyond, natural limits. Projections are for continued and, likely, increased warming trends across the region, with a near certainty of continuing changes in seasonality of snowmelt and streamflows, and a strong potential for attendant increases in evaporative demands. Projections of future precipitation are less conclusive, although likely the northernmost West will see precipitation increases while the southernmost West sees declines. However, most of the region lies in a broad area where some climate models project precipitation increases while others project declines, so that only increases in precipitation uncertainties can be projected with any confidence. Changes in annual and seasonal hydrographs are likely to challenge water managers, users, and attempts to protect or restore environmental flows, even where annual volumes change little. Other impacts from climate change (e.g., floods and water-quality changes) are poorly understood and will likely be location dependent.},

  abstract = {Monitoring volumetric soil water content ({\texttheta}v) is the key for assessing water availability and nutrient fluxes. This study evaluated the empirical accuracy of {\texttheta}v measurements using standard and in situ calibrated frequency domain reflectometers (FDR) with gravimetric water content and bulk density measurements of 1512 samples gathered from 15 profiles across 5 ICP Forests level II intensive monitoring plots. The predicted {\texttheta}v, calibrated with standard functions, predominantly underestimated the real water content. The measurement error exceeded the threshold of 0.03 m3 m-3 in 93\% of all soil layers. Layer specific calibration removed bias and reduced the overall prediction error with a factor up to 2.8. A simple linear regression often provided the best calibration model; temperature correction was helpful in specific cases. To adequately remove bias in our study plots, a calibration dataset of up to 24 monthly observations was required for topsoils (whereas 12 observations sufficed for subsoils). Based on estimated precision errors, 3 sensors per soil layer proved to be sufficient, while up to 16 sensors are needed to meet the required accuracy in organic topsoils. Validating FDR sensor outputs using in situ gravimetric measurements is essential for quality control and assurance of long term {\texttheta}v monitoring and for improving site specific instrumentalization.},

  abstract = {In years of increasing impact of climate change effects, a reliable characterization of the spatiotemporal evolutionary dynamics of evapotranspiration can enable a significant improvement in water resource management, especially as regards irrigation activities. Sicily, an insular region of Southern Italy, has exceptionally valuable agricultural production and high irrigation needs. In this study, the ETo reference evapotranspiration in Sicily was first evaluated on the basis of historical and future climate parameters, referring for future values to two climate scenarios characterized by different Representative Concentration Pathways: RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5. Then, the Hierarchical algorithm was used to divide Sicily into three homogeneous regions, each characterized by specific ETo features. In addition, some Machine Learning (ML) algorithms were used to develop forecasting models based on only historical data. Support Vector Regression (SVR) was used to predict the future values of Tmin and Tmax, while an ensemble model based on Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and M5P Regression Tree was developed for the ETo forecasting. Predictions made with the ensemble MLP-M5P model were compared with the ETo computed for the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 future climate scenarios. During the forecast period, from 2001 to 2091, evapotranspiration increases were observed for all three clusters. For cluster C1, along the coast, percentage increases of 7.52\%, 14.64\% and 10.78\%, were computed for RCP 4.5, RCP 8.5, and MLP-M5P, respectively, while, for cluster C3, in the inland, percentage increases were higher and equal to 8.12\%, 16.71\%, and 14.98\%, respectively. The ensemble MLP-M5P model led to intermediate trends between RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, showing a high correlation with the latter (R2 between 0.93 and 0.98). The developed approach, based on both clustering and forecasting algorithms, provided a comprehensive analysis of the reference evapotranspiration, with the detection of the different homogeneous regions and, at the same time, the evaluation of the evapotranspiration trends, both in coastal and inland areas.},

The objective of this paper is to investigate the role played by stemflow infiltration in sub\- surface water flow dynamics, focusing on a forested hillslope located in an Aleppo pine Mediterranean forest (Pinus halepensis, Mill.) located at Sierra Calderona, Valencia province, Spain. We combined stemflow artificial experiments with the ground-penetrating radar (GPR) as a non-invasive technique to investigate stemflowinduced preferential flow paths activated by different trees and the related hydrological connectivity at the hillslope scale. Our observations allowed us to identify different dynamics associated with the initiation of stemflow and then lateral preferential flow, including the activation of connected preferential flow paths that received stemflow water from different trees. These observations provided empirical evidence of the role of stemflow in the formation of lateral preferential flow networks. Our measurements also provided estimations for flow velocities, which provided new insight on the magnitude of stem-induced lateral preferential flow paths. The applied protocol offers a simple, repeatable and non-invasive way to conceptualize hillslope responses to rainstorms.},

CSV is a very simple format, yet we show that it gives rise to a surprisingly large amount of ambiguities in its parsing and interpretation. We summarize the state-of-the-art in CSV parsers, which typically make a linear series of parsing and interpretation decisions, such that any wrong decision at an earlier stage can negatively affect all downstream decisions. Since computation time is much less scarce than human time, we propose to turn CSV parsing into a ranking problem. Our quality-oriented multi-hypothesis CSV parsing approach generates several concurrent hypotheses about dialect, table structure, etc. and ranks these hypotheses based on quality features of the resulting table. This approach makes it possible to create an advanced CSV parser that makes many different decisions, yet keeps the overall parser code a simple plug-in infrastructure. The complex interactions between these decisions are taken care of by searching the hypothesis space rather than by having to program these many interactions in code. We show that our approach leads to better parsing results than the state of the art and facilitates the parsing of large corpora of heterogeneous CSV files.},

Finding an effective way to determine the length of the steel reinforcement in bored in situ concrete piles has been an urgent but difficult problem for the construction administration agencies in China. Taking advantage of the significant difference in the electrical conductivity between the steel reinforcement and the concrete pile body, we apply the mise-a-lamasse (MALM) method, which has traditionally been used in ore exploration and coal mining, to determine the reinforcement length of bored in situ concrete piles. Preliminary tests show that the voltage (electrical potential) curve sharply increases at the bottom of the steel reinforcements, where the voltage gradient curve also peaks. Thus, the MALM method could be an effective, fast and convenient way to determine the reinforcement length in bored in situ concrete piles. The MALM method may also be used in the survey of old steel piles, bridge footings and dam foundations whose configurations are not available.},

We used a ground electromagnetic conductivity meter to survey eight dairies in the region to determine the source of contamination. Ground conductivities were highest in the loafing areas on most dairies. These are the corrals or small fields near the barn where the milking herd is kept when it is not in the barn or on pasture and other areas near the barn where there is high animal traffic. Conductivities were typically 15 to 20 mS m               -1               in these areas, compared with {$<$}10 mS m               -1               in the pastures away from barns. Water samples from groundwater monitoring wells installed in the loafing areas on three dairies to depths of 7 to 10 m had NO               3               -N concentrations between 47 and 135 mg L               -1               . Shallow ground conductivities in the vicinity of these wells were 10 to 24 mS m               -1               . There was evidence of seepage at three of the six lagoons we surveyed, but the loafing areas appeared to be a greater threat to drinking water supplies because they were closer to the milking barn where the supply well was located. Stocking rates were probably high enough in the loafing areas to result in excessive N deposition from manure, but not high enough to cause anerobic conditions that would inhibit mineralization or promote denitrification. Best management practices need to be developed that address NO               3               leaching from loafing areas.},

  abstract = {Geophysical methods have long been used in earth and environmental science for the characterization of subsurface properties. While imaging the subsurface opens the ``black box'' of subsurface heterogeneity, we argue here that these tools can be used in a more powerful way than characterization, which is to develop and test hypotheses. Critical zone science has opened new questions and hypotheses in the hydrologic sciences holistically around controls on water fluxes between surface, biological, and underground compartments. While groundwater flows can be monitored in boreholes, water fluxes from the atmosphere to the aquifer through the soil and the root system are more complex to study than boreholes can inform upon. Here, we focus on the successful application of various geophysical tools to explore hypotheses in critical zone hydrogeology and highlight areas where future contributions could be made. Specifically, we look at questions around subsurface structural controls on flow, the dimensionality and partitioning of those flows in the subsurface, plant water uptake, and how geophysics may be used to constrain reactive transport. We also outline areas of future research that may push the boundaries of how geophysical methods are used to quantify critical zone complexity.},

  abstract = {Summary             The transferability of soil hydraulic properties measured in the laboratory to the field or catchment scale is a key problem in soil hydrology. To narrow the gap between laboratory and field scale we investigated soil water movement at the lysimeter scale. Specific questions of interest are the existence and uniqueness of effective hydraulic properties for lysimeters that are internally heterogeneous. To answer these questions, synthetic measurements of water contents, pressure heads, and fluxes across the system boundaries were generated by forward modelling of water flow, based on the Richards equation, for a variety of homogeneous and layered soils and under varying types of boundary conditions (multistep outflow, evaporation, transient atmospheric). We evaluated the measurements by inverse modelling assuming a homogeneous system. The globally convergent shuffled complex evolution algorithm was applied to avoid parameter estimation problems caused by a rough topology of the objective function. The hydraulic properties of homogeneous soils were always uniquely identified, not only for the classic multistep outflow and evaporation experiments but also under natural atmospheric boundary conditions. Moreover, for the weakly heterogeneous layered soils, the soil water dynamics could be well described with effective homogeneous properties. For highly heterogeneous, layered soils, it was still possible to match the boundary fluxes for all types of experiments. Internal system states could not be matched, however, and the properties identified depended on the type of experiment. For these soils no unique effective soil hydraulic properties exist. We found that for strongly layered soils the simultaneous determination of the hydraulic properties of multiple soil layers by inverse modelling is a practicable alternative to the description with effective parameters.},

To determine the effects of hypoxia on maize (Zea mays cv. Seneca Horizon) roots, seedlings were grown in vermiculite (VERM), aerated hydroponics (AER), stagnant hydroponics with agar (STAG), or aerated hydroponics with agar (AERAG). The endo- and exodermis were examined for wall modifications. Lateral root emergence and aerenchyma formation were documented qualitatively. The endodermal Casparian band formation was unaffected by treatment. Endodermal and exodermal suberin lamella formation was earliest and most extensive in VERM. Suberization, especially in the exodermis of aerated treatments, was depressed in all hydroponic media. In comparison with AER, STAG exodermal lamellae were increased, but endodermal lamellae were decreased. Since the suberized exodermis forms a barrier to radial oxygen loss from roots to the medium, its stimulation in STAG roots (which also developed extensive aerenchyma) would help retain oxygen in the root. The reduction of endodermal lamellae should facilitate oxygen diffusion into the stele. Clearly, the response to environmental conditions is variable within individual cortical cell layers. Additionally, the observed patterns of lamellae, aerenchyma and lateral root development indicate a tight radial co-ordination of root development.},

In particular, it will be shown, from different vantage points, that EM induction operates in the magnetoquasistatic regime in which inductive effects dominate, capacitive effects are ignored, and the displacement current is negligible; hence, charge polarization and dielectric phenomena play no role. We determine some of the major physical consequences of this approximation, and we make a distinction between wave physics and diffusive behavior, which is of particular interest in the special case of time-periodic excitation. We distinguish the fundamentally different roles of mobile charge carriers and bound charges in EM induction. It is emphasized that EM induction cannot be fully understood by comparing and contrasting Maxwell's equations with governing equations from other disciplines that possess a similar mathematical structure. It is suggested that visualizations of energy flow using the Poynting vector and the Joule heating parameters provide a powerful tool to understand how the geologic medium shapes EM induction responses.},

  abstract = {Diffusive heat flux at the soil surface is commonly determined as a mean value over a time period using heat flux plates buried at some depth (e.g., 5--8 cm) below the surface with a correction to surface flux based on the change in heat storage during the corresponding time period in the soil layer above the plates. The change in heat storage is based on the soil temperature change in the layer over the time period and an estimate of the soil thermal heat capacity that is based on soil water content, bulk density and organic matter content. One- or multiple-layer corrections using some measure of mean soil temperature over the layer depth are common; and in some cases the soil water content has been determined, although rarely. Several problems with the heat flux plate method limit the accuracy of soil heat flux values. An alternative method is presented and this flux gradient method is compared with soil heat flux plate measurements. The method is based on periodic (e.g., half-hourly) water content and temperature sensing at multiple depths within the soil profile and a solution of the Fourier heat flux equation. A Fourier sine series is fit to the temperature at each depth and the temperature at the next depth below is simulated with a sine series solution of the differential heat flux equation using successive approximation of the best fit based on changing the thermal diffusivity value. The best fit thermal diffusivity value is converted to a thermal conductivity value using the soil heat capacity, which is based on the measured water content and bulk density. A statistical analysis of the many data resulting from repeated application of this method is applied to describe the thermal conductivity as a function of water content and bulk density. The soil heat flux between each pair of temperature measurement depths is computed using the thermal conductivity function and measured water contents. The thermal gradient method of heat flux calculation compared well to values determined using heat flux plates and calorimetric correction to the soil surface; and it provided better representation of the surface spatiotemporal variation of heat flux and more accurate heat flux values. The overall method resulted in additional important knowledge including the water content dynamics in the near-surface soil profile and a soil-specific function relating thermal conductivity to soil water content and bulk density.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Understanding the interrelation between topography and vegetation across different environments is important to assess how hydrological and climatic conditions affect tree physiological activity. This becomes especially important given the expected reduction in water availability and the increase in water demand driven by climate change. These extremes could enhance the thermal and hydrologic gradients along slopes. Here, we aimed to test if and how different climatic and hydrological conditions affect the physiological response of beech trees (Fagus sylvatica~L.) to environmental variables along two different topographic sequences. For this purpose, we set up a comparative study on a gentle hillslope in the Weierbach catchment in Luxembourg (oceanic climate) and on a steep hillslope in the Lecciona catchment in Italy (Mediterranean climate). We combined sap velocity measurements with isotopic measurements of soil, precipitation, stream water, groundwater, and xylem over 2019 and 2020 for the Luxembourgish site and over 2021 for the Italian site. We found that, in the Weierbach catchment, trees' responses to environmental variables (i.e. vapour pressure deficit and relative extractable water in the soil) were similar among hillslope positions and between the two monitored years, resulting from homogeneous growing conditions along the topographic sequence. We also did not find any statistical difference in the isotopic composition of xylem water between positions, suggesting that beech trees relied on similar water sources across the landscape. In the Lecciona catchment, we observed lower sap velocities and shorter growing season in trees growing in the upper portions of the hillslope, likely related to water redistribution and different soil moisture along the hillslope catena. Xylem isotopic composition was significantly lighter at the footslope location throughout the growing season than in the upslope locations, suggesting location-specific water use. These results emphasize how differing hydrometeorological processes occurring at the hillslope scale can lead to contrasting tree responses.},

  abstract = {Sea level rise and storm surges affect coastal forests along low-lying shorelines. Salinization and flooding kill trees and favour the encroachment of salt-tolerant marsh vegetation. The hydrology of this ecological transition is complex and requires a multidisciplinary approach. Sea level rise (press) and storms (pulses) act on different timescales, affecting the forest vegetation in different ways. Salinization can occur either by vertical infiltration during flooding or from the aquifer driven by tides and sea level rise. Here, we detail the ecohydrological processes acting in the critical zone of retreating coastal forests. An increase in sea level has a three-pronged effect on flooding and salinization: It raises the maximum elevation of storm surges, shifts the freshwatersaltwater interface inland, and elevates the water table, leading to surface flooding from below. Trees can modify their root systems and local soil hydrology to better withstand salinization. Hydrological stress from intermittent storm surges inhibits tree growth, as evidenced by tree ring analysis. Tree rings also reveal a lag between the time when tree growth significantly slows and when the tree ultimately dies. Tree dieback reduces transpiration, retaining more water in the soil and creating conditions more favourable for flooding. Sedimentation from storm waters combined to organic matter decomposition can change the landscape, affecting flooding and runoff. Our results indicate that only a multidisciplinary approach can fully capture the ecohydrology of retreating forests in a period of accelerated sea level rise.},

  abstract = {Scarcity of water is a severe environmental constraint to plant productivity. Drought-induced loss in crop yield probably exceeds losses from all other causes, since both the severity and duration of the stress are critical. Here, we have reviewed the effects of drought stress on the growth, phenology, water and nutrient relations, photosynthesis, assimilate partitioning, and respiration in plants. This article also describes the mechanism of drought resistance in plants on a morphological, physiological and molecular basis. Various management strategies have been proposed to cope with drought stress. Drought stress reduces leaf size, stem extension and root proliferation, disturbs plant water relations and reduces water-use efficiency. Plants display a variety of physiological and biochemical responses at cellular and whole-organism levels towards prevailing drought stress, thus making it a complex phenomenon. CO2 assimilation by leaves is reduced mainly by stomatal closure, membrane damage and disturbed activity of various enzymes, especially those of CO2 fixation and adenosine triphosphate synthesis. Enhanced metabolite flux through the photorespiratory pathway increases the oxidative load on the tissues as both processes generate reactive oxygen species. Injury caused by reactive oxygen species to biological macromolecules under drought stress is among the major deterrents to growth. Plants display a range of mechanisms to withstand drought stress. The major mechanisms include curtailed water loss by increased diffusive resistance, enhanced water uptake with prolific and deep root systems and its efficient use, and smaller and succulent leaves to reduce the transpirational loss. Among the nutrients, potassium ions help in osmotic adjustment; silicon increases root endodermal silicification and improves the cell water balance. Low-molecular-weight osmolytes, including glycinebetaine, proline and other amino acids, organic acids, and polyols, are crucial to sustain cellular functions under drought. Plant growth substances such as salicylic acid, auxins, gibberrellins, cytokinin and abscisic acid modulate the plant responses towards drought. Polyamines, citrulline and several enzymes act as antioxidants and reduce the adverse effects of water deficit. At molecular levels several drought-responsive genes and transcription factors have been identified, such as the dehydration-responsive element-binding gene, aquaporin, late embryogenesis abundant proteins and dehydrins. Plant drought tolerance can be managed by adopting strategies such as mass screening and breeding, marker-assisted selection and exogenous application of hormones and osmoprotectants to seed or growing plants, as well as engineering for drought resistance.},

Criticized by some as over-parameterized, overly complex, and difficult to use, a more nuanced view is that these tools are necessary in many situations and, in a certain class of problems, they are the most appropriate type of hydrological model. This is especially the case in situations where knowledge of flow paths or distributed state variables and/or preservation of physical constraints is important. Examples of this include: spatiotemporal variability of soil moisture, groundwater flow and runoff generation, sediment and contaminant transport, or when feedbacks among various Earth's system processes or understanding the impacts of climate non-stationarity are of primary concern. These are situations where process-based models excel and other models are unverifiable. This article presents this pragmatic view in the context of existing literature to justify the approach where applicable and necessary. We review how improvements in data availability, computational resources and algorithms have made detailed hydrological simulations a reality. Avenues for the future of process-based hydrological models are presented suggesting their use as virtual laboratories, for design purposes, and with a powerful treatment of uncertainty.},

This research aims to test two undisturbed methods, electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and HYDRUS 2D/3D, for 2D  determination in a thorny forest ecosystem. The experiment consisted of infiltrating 10 L of water lasting 60\,min. During infiltration, ERT measured apparent resistivity by time-lapse measurements, and  was measured with an FDR probe (EnviroSCAN) at 33, 63, 83, 97, and 163\,cm depth close to the infiltration site. At the end of infiltration, a soil pit was dug, and 100 measurements of  were performed with a TDR in a 10\,{\texttimes}\,10\,cm regular grid. Archie law transformed soil resistivity (ERT) into  using manual calibration, verified by an independent dataset. The 2D  profile obtained by ERT was qualitatively compared with the HYDRUS 2D/3D one. HYDRUS 2D/3D was parametrized with calibrated parameters obtained with HYDRUS 1D using 106\,days of  obtained with EnviroSCAN. The results of HYDRUS 1D calibration and verification were satisfactory, with RMSE and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients ranging from 0.021 to 0.034\,cm               3               \,cm               -3               and 0.11 to 0.77, respectively. The forward HYDRUS 2D/3D  simulation disagrees with EnviroSCAN data for 33\,cm depth. However, it follows the trend with near to zero variation of water content at 63\,cm depth. Water content determination by ERT was satisfactory with RMSE for calibration and verification of 0.017 and 0.021\,cm               3               \,cm               -3               . HYDRUS 2D/3D and ERT comparisons were not equal, with a shallower wetting front by ERT and a deeper one for HYDRUS. Still, both wetting fronts agree with the wetting depth estimated by EnviroSCAN. We conclude that both methods are an alternative for  determination in heterogeneous and deep soils of forest ecosystems.},

The extractable metals identified by DTPA, EDTA, CaCl2 and NaNO3 methods exhibited relatively poor or no correlation with the metal content of barley roots. The stepwise multiple regression equation of the rhizosphere-based method was the simplest one, as no soil properties needed to be entered, whereas the equations for the DTPA, EDTA, CaCl2 and NaNO3 extraction methods always require those variables. The most distinct feature of the rhizosphere-based method was that the proposed method was suitable for acidic, neutral and near alkaline soils. In contrast, the other extraction methods were restricted to soil types.

Evapotranspiration (ET) controls the GI's hydrologic performance and affects all related benefits. Essentially, ET constrains the turnover of moisture storage and determines the demand for supplemental irrigation and then the cost-effectiveness of a GI project. Considering the spatial heterogeneousness of an urban space and the GI's multi-layer designs, the classic ET equations have challenges in representing the ET variations from GI units. The underperformance of the existing ET models is partly due to the lack of corresponding high-quality field observations for each GI type in various urban settings. This chapter, therefore, summarizes the current research progress and existing challenges regarding the benefit, measurement, and simulation of ET process from GI.},

However, efforts to relate complex conductivities associated with IP to intrinsic physical properties of the corresponding materials have been largely empirical. Here we present a quantitative interpretation of induced polarization signatures from brine-filled rock formations with conductive inclusions and show that new opportunities in geophysical exploration and characterization could arise. Initially tested with model systems with solid conductive inclusions, this theory is then extended and experimentally tested with nanoporous conductors that are shown to have a distinctive spectral IP response. Several of the tests were conducted with nano-porous sulfides (pyrite) produced by sulfate-reducing bacteria grown in the lab in the presence of a hydrocarbon source, as well as with field samples from sapropel formations. Our discoveries and fundamental understanding of the electrode polarization mechanism with solid and porous conductive inclusions suggest a rigorous new approach in geophysical exploration for mineral deposits. Moreover, we show how induced polarization of biologically generated mineral deposits can yield a new paradigm for basin scale hydrocarbon exploration.},

  abstract = {At present and more so in the future, irrigated agriculture will take place under water scarcity. Insufficient water supply for irrigation will be the norm rather than the exception, and irrigation management will shift from emphasizing production per unit area towards maximizing the production per unit of water consumed, the water productivity. To cope with scarce supplies, deficit irrigation, defined as the application of water below full crop-water requirements (evapotranspiration), is an important tool to achieve the goal of reducing irrigation water use. While deficit irrigation is widely practised over millions of hectares for a number of reasons---from inadequate network design to excessive irrigation expansion relative to catchment supplies---it has not received sufficient attention in research. Its use in reducing water consumption for biomass production, and for irrigation of annual and perennial crops is reviewed here. There is potential for improving water productivity in many field crops and there is sufficient information for defining the best deficit irrigation strategy for many situations. One conclusion is that the level of irrigation supply under deficit irrigation should be relatively high in most cases, one that permits achieving 60--100\% of full evapotranspiration. Several cases on the successful use of regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) in fruit trees and vines are reviewed, showing that RDI not only increases water productivity, but also farmers' profits. Research linking the physiological basis of these responses to the design of RDI strategies is likely to have a significant impact in increasing its adoption in water-limited areas.},

  abstract = {Time-domain-induced polarization has significantly broadened its field of reference during the last decade, from mineral exploration to environmental geophysics, e.g., for clay and peat identification and landfill characterization. Though, insufficient modeling tools have hitherto limited the use of time-domain-induced polarization for wider purposes. For these reasons, a new forward code and inversion algorithm have been developed using the full-time decay of the induced polarization response, together with an accurate description of the transmitter waveform and of the receiver transfer function, to reconstruct the distribution of the Cole-Cole parameters of the earth. The accurate modeling of the transmitter waveform had a strong influence on the forward response, and we showed that the difference between a solution using a step response and a solution using the accurate modeling often is above 100\%. Furthermore, the presence of low-pass filters in time-domain-induced polarization instruments affects the early times of the acquired decays (typically up to 100~ms) and has to be modeled in the forward response to avoid significant loss of resolution. The developed forward code has been implemented in a 1D laterally constrained inversion algorithm that extracts the spectral content of the induced polarization phenomenon in terms of the Cole-Cole parameters. Synthetic examples and field examples from Denmark showed a significant improvement in the resolution of the parameters that control the induced polarization response when compared to traditional integral chargeability inversion. The quality of the inversion results has been assessed by a complete uncertainty analysis of the model parameters; furthermore, borehole information confirm the outcomes of the field interpretations. With this new accurate code in situ time-domain-induced polarization measurements give access to new applications in environmental and hydrogeophysical investigations, e.g., accurate landfill delineation or on the relation between Cole-Cole and hydraulic parameters.},

  abstract = {The induced polarization phenomenon, both in time domain and frequency domain, is often parameterised using the empirical Cole--Cole model. To improve the resolution of model parameters and to decrease the parameter correlations in the inversion process of induced polarization data, we suggest here three re-parameterisations of the Cole--Cole model, namely the maximum phase angle Cole--Cole model, the maximum imaginary conductivity Cole--Cole model, and the minimum imaginary resistivity Cole--Cole model. The maximum phase angle Cole--Cole model uses the maximum phase {$\phi$}max and the inverse of the phase peak frequency, {$\tau$} {$\phi$}, instead of the intrinsic charge-ability m0 and the time constant adopted in the classic Cole--Cole model. The maximum imaginary conductivity Cole--Cole model uses the maximum imaginary conductivity {$\sigma$} {$\prime$}m{$\prime$}ax instead of m0 and the time constant {$\tau$} {$\sigma$} of the Cole--Cole model in its conductivity form. The minimum imaginary resistivity Cole--Cole model uses the minimum imaginary resistivity {$\rho\prime$}m{$\prime$} in instead of m0 and the time constant {$\tau\rho$} of the Cole--Cole model in its resistivity form.},

  abstract = {In this study, we investigate the applicability of the Induced Polarization (IP) imaging method to discriminate between biogeochemically active and inactive areas of a landfill. The elevated amount of degradable organic carbon in landfills results in the development of biogeochemical hot-spots associated with high rates of microbial activity and the generation of landfill gas and leachate as metabolic products. Our results demonstrate that the electrical conductivity is mainly sensitive to the increase in the fluid conductivity associated to leachate production and migration. Whereas images of the polarization effect, expressed in terms of the imaginary component (r00) or the phase of the complex conductivity (/), reveal the potential to characterize variations in the architecture and biogeochemical activity of the landfill. Correspondingly, biogeochemically active zones (leachable TOC contents above 1500 mg/kg dry waste) are related to high polarization values (r00 {$>$} 10 mS/m, / {$>$} 40 mrads), whereas low leachable TOC contents ({$<$}300 mg/kg dry waste) in the inactive areas are characterized by low polarization values (r00 {$<$} 1 mS/m, 10 {$<$} / {$<$} 25). Additionally, landfill sections corresponding to construction and demolition waste (CDW), associated to negligible TOC content, exhibit the lowest polarization response (r00 {$<$} 0.1 mS/m, / {$<$} 15). We prove that IP imaging is a well-suited method for landfill investigations that permits an improved characterization of landfill geometry, variation in waste composition, and the discrimination between biogeochemically active and inactive zones.},

Conductivity images reveal a poor correlation with the distribution of contaminants; whereas phase images exhibit two main anomalies: low phase shift values (b5 mrad) for locations with high BTEX concentrations, including the occurrence of free-phase product (BTEX concentrations {$>$}1.7 g/l), and higher phase values for lower BTEX concentrations. Moreover, the spectral response of the areas with high BTEX concentration and free-phase products reveals a flattened spectrum in the low frequencies (b40 Hz), while areas with lower BTEX concentrations exhibit a response characterized by a frequency peak. The SIP response was modelled using a Debye decomposition to compute images of the median relaxation-time. Consistent with laboratory studies, we observed an increase in the relaxation-time associated with an increase in BTEX concentrations. Measurements were also collected in the time domain (TDIP), revealing imaging results consistent with those obtained for frequency domain (SIP) measurements. Results presented here demonstrate the potential of the SIP imaging method to discriminate source and plume of dissolved contaminants at BTEX contaminated sites.},

The aims of the SIP surveys were to (a) collect data over a sufficiently broad bandwidth so as to determine the characteristic frequency of the spectral response (at which the strongest polarization response takes places), (b) investigate the distribution of spectral parameters (e.g., characteristic time constant) in an imaging framework and (c) evaluate the potential of these images to delineate changes in the hydraulic properties of the aquifer. Careful field procedures provided high-quality SIP data from 0.060--256 Hz for three different periods during the remediation experiment. Data quality was evaluated by means of analysis of the discrepancy between normal and reciprocal measurements. A Cole-Cole model was fitted to pixel values extracted from the inverted images in order to assess changes in the SIP response -- particularly in time constant (                              ) and chargeability (               m               ) -- due to processes accompanying the stimulation of subsurface microbial activity.

The reliability of the imaged spectral parameters was assessed by means of a numerical study.},

However, to date, monitoring of mZVI particle injection is based on chemical analysis of groundwater and soil samples and thus might be limited in its spatiotemporal resolution. To overcome this deficiency, in this study, we investigate the application of complex electrical conductivity imaging, a geophysical method, to monitor the high-pressure injection of mZVI in a fieldscale application. The resulting electrical images revealed an increase in the induced electrical polarization ({$\sim$}20\%), upon delivery of ZVI into the targeted area, due to the accumulation of metallic surfaces at which the polarization takes place. Furthermore, larger changes ({$>$}50\%) occurred in shallow sediments, a few meters away from the injection, suggesting the migration of particles through preferential flowpaths. Correlation of the electrical response and geochemical data, in particular the analysis of recovered cores from drilling after the injection, confirmed the migration of particles (and stabilizing solution) to shallow areas through fractures formed during the injection. Hence, our results demonstrate the suitability of the complex conductivity imaging method to monitor the transport of mZVI during subsurface amendment in quasi real-time.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the time-domain induced polarization (TDIP) imaging technique has emerged as a suitable method for the characterization and the monitoring of hydrogeologic and biogeochemical processes. However, one of the major challenges refers to the resolution of the electrical images. Hence, various studies have stressed the importance of data processing, error characterization, and the deployment of adequate inversion schemes. A widely accepted method to assess data error in electrical imaging relies on the analysis of the discrepancy between normal and reciprocal measurements. Nevertheless, the collection of reciprocals doubles the acquisition time and is only viable for a limited subset of commonly used electrode configurations (e.g., dipole-dipole [DD]). To overcome these limitations, we have developed a new methodology to quantify the data error in TDIP imaging, which is entirely based on the analysis of the recorded IP decay curve and does not require recollection of data (e.g., reciprocals). The first two steps of the methodology assess the general characteristics of the decay curves and the spatial consistency of the measurements for the detection and removal of outliers. In the third and fourth steps, we quantify the deviation of the measured decay curves from a smooth model for the estimation of random error of the total chargeability and transfer resistance measurement. The error models and imaging results obtained from this methodology --- in the following referred to as ``decay curve analysis'' --- are compared with those obtained following a conventional normal-reciprocal analysis revealing consistent results. We determine the applicability of our methodology with real field data collected at the floodplain scale (approximately 12~ha) using multiple gradient and DD configurations.},

Beside other limitations (e.g. costs, delivery, longevity, non-target specific reactions), concerns of regulators arose regarding toxicity of injected NP and particles delivered off-target (i.e. renegade particles). Renegade particles also significantly reduce the efficiency of the remediation. The delivery of particles off-target is caused, mainly, by unintended fracking, where the fractures act then as preferential flow paths changing the trajectory of the particles. Hence, the real-time monitoring of particle injection is of major importance to verify correct particle delivery and thus help to optimize the remediation strategy.

To overcome these limitations, in this study we investigate the applicability of complex-conductivity imaging (CCI), a geophysical electrical method, to characterize possible pore clogging and fracking during NP injections. We hypothesize that both processes are related to different electrical footprints, considering the loss of porosity during clogging and the accumulation of NP in areas away of the target after fracking. Here, we present CCI results for data collected before and during the injection of Nano-Goethite particles (NGP) applied to enhance biodegradation of a BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene) contaminant plume. Imaging results for background data revealed consistency with the known lithology, while overall high electrical conductivity values and a negligible inducedpolarization magnitude correspond with the expected response of a mature hydrocarbon plume. Monitoring images revealed a general increase ({$\sim$}15 per cent) in the electrical conductivity due to the injected NGP suspension in agreement with geochemical data. Furthermore, abrupt changes in this trend, shortly before daylighting events, show the sensitivity of the method to pore clogging. Such interpretation is in line with the larger variations in CCI resolved in the unsaturated zone, clearly indicating the accumulation of renegade NGP close to the surface due to fracking.

According to legend, the Hill of Udine (NE Italy) was built by Attila the Hun's soldiers, but its origin (natural or anthropogenic) has been debated until now. Our research analyzed five new 40-m long stratigraphic cores, investigating for the first time the total thickness of the hill and compared the data with the available archaeological information. Moreover, we considered other hills and mounds in northern Italy and other European regions where folklore traditions relate their origin to Attila. The geoarchaeological and ethnographic data prove that the Hill of Udine is a Bronze Age anthropogenic mound erected between 1400 and 1150 BCE and that, later, folklore has transformed the ancestral memory of its origin into legend. By measuring 30~m in height and over 400,000 m               3               in volume, the flat-topped hill is the largest prehistoric mound in Europe.

  abstract = {The frequency and severity of droughts in the Alps are expected to increase due to rising air temperatures and changes in precipitation regimes. Although biomass production in humid mountain areas tends to be energy limited rather than water limited, an increase in droughts may have negative impacts on the water availability and thus agricultural yields. This study aimed to analyse the impacts of dry spells on soil moisture and yield anomalies at a montane permanent grassland site in Austria. Dry spells in the time period from 2018 to 2020 were identified using the Standardized Precipitation Index, Palmer Drought Severity Index and the Soil Moisture Anomaly Index. Data from a lysimeter climate experiment were used to evaluate drought impacts on soil water storage and grassland yield under ambient and manipulated conditions. The results indicated the occurrence of three extreme droughts between 2018 and 2020. Although the studied grassland is generally considered a nonwater-limited ecosystem, the most extreme drought in summer 2019 caused severe and extreme yield anomalies under ambient and heated conditions. Only mild yield anomalies were observed on plots with elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration. This drought-mitigating effect was attributed to the water savings enabled by partial stomatal closure under elevated CO2. The shorter dry spells in spring and late summer 2018 led to more diverse effects; mildly to moderately negative yield anomalies were found on the heated plots, whereas the anomalies tended to be less negative or even positive on plots under ambient temperature. In contrast, some time periods without water stress showed positive effects of heating on yield. These findings suggest that drought impacts on a humid montane grassland depend on both water availability and air temperature. Higher air temperature can have positive effects on yield if the ecosystem is energy limited. However, global warming suggests a tendency from energy to water limitation, in which the increased evaporative demand of the atmosphere aggravates soil moisture droughts and thus has potentially negative effects on yield.},

Finally, the dielectric properties of tissues are summarized as empirical correlations with tissue water content in other compositional variables; in addition, a comprehensive table is presented of dielectric properties.

  abstract = {In this work, the performance of the TEROS 12 electromagnetic sensor, which measures volumetric soil water content ({\texttheta}), bulk soil electrical conductivity ({$\sigma$}b), and temperature, is examined for a number of different soils, different {\texttheta} and different levels of the electrical conductivity of the soil solution (ECW) under laboratory conditions. For the above reason, a prototype device was developed including a low-cost microcontroller and suitable adaptation circuits for the aforementioned sensor. Six characteristic porous media were examined in a {\texttheta} range from air drying to saturation, while four different solutions of increasing Electrical Conductivity (ECw) from 0.28 dS/m to approximately 10 dS/m were used in four of these porous media. It was found that TEROS 12 apparent dielectric permittivity ({$\varepsilon$}a) readings were lower than that of Topp's permittivity--water content relationship, especially at higher soil water content values in the coarse porous bodies. The differences are observed in sand (S), sandy loam (SL) and loam (L), at this order. The results suggested that the relationship between experimentally measured soil water content ({\texttheta}m) and {$\varepsilon$}a0.5 was strongly linear (0.869 {$<$} R2 {$<$} 0.989), but the linearity of the relation {\texttheta}m-{$\varepsilon$}a0.5 decreases with the increase in bulk EC ({$\sigma$}b) of the soil. The most accurate results were provided by the multipoint calibration method (CAL), as evaluated with the root mean square error (RMSE). Also, it was found that {$\varepsilon$}a degrades substantially at values of {$\sigma$}b less than 2.5 dS/m while {$\varepsilon$}a returns to near 80 at higher values. Regarding the relation {$\varepsilon$}a-{$\sigma$}b, it seems that it is strongly linear and that its slope depends on the pore water electrical conductivity ({$\sigma$}p) and the soil type.},

Thermogravimetric-differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) of organic species provides information on thermal reactions, the amount and properties of clay structural water, organic species and carbonates.                                                     The accuracy of LOI compared with that of TG-DTA was evaluated in 33 sediment samples from the Lagoon of Venice (Italy).                                                     In all tests conducted with TG-DTA the mass loss of OM and the loss of clay structural water (LCSW) from oxidized samples were measured. The mass loss of OM at 350{$^\circ$}C (TG-DTA 350 OM) and the total extraction of organic matter at 567{$^\circ$}C (TEOM) calculated from the difference between natural state samples and oxidized samples highlight the presence of both thermally labile and thermally stable substances.                                                     The grain size data of sediment samples from the Lagoon shows a variable distribution between slightly muddy sand and mud. Loss of clay structural water at 350{$^\circ$}C (LCSW 350) and total extraction of clay structural water at 567{$^\circ$}C (TECSW) both estimated by TG-DTA on oxidized samples, were found to correspond approximately to 6\% and 10\%, respectively of the clay fraction ({$<$}4 {\textmu}m). This percentage may be used to correct LOI measurements of OM in sediments with high clay content.                                                     LOI 350 (loss on ignition at 350{$^\circ$}C) and LOI 550 (loss on ignition at 550{$^\circ$}C) proved to be {$\sim$}80\% and {$\sim$}200\%, respectively, of total extraction of mass loss at 350{$^\circ$}C (TG-DTA 350 tot) and at 567{$^\circ$}C (TEML) estimated by TG-DTA on natural samples, meaning that the LOI 550 value represents a significant overestimate. The difference between the LOI 550 and TEML values indicates that the mass loss excess (MLE) may be accounted for by losses due to breakdown of carbonates.

But such calibration may be difficult or impractical, for example when soil contains stones, in presence of bedrock outcrops, in urban environments, or when the probe is used as a rover. Here we use the neutron transport code MCNPx with observed soil chemistries and pore water distribution to derive a universal calibration function that can be used in such environments. Reasonable estimates of pore water content can be made from neutron intensity measurements and by using measurements of the other hydrogen pools (water vapor, soil lattice water, soil organic carbon, and biomass). Comparisons with independent soil moisture measurements at one cosmic-ray probe site and, separately, at 35 sites, show that the universal calibration function explains more than 79 \% of the total variability within each dataset, permitting accurate isolation of the soil moisture signal from the measured neutron intensity signal. In addition the framework allows for any of the other hydrogen pools to be separated from the neutron intensity measurements, which may be useful for estimating changes in biomass, biomass water, or exchangeable water in complex environments.},

Thus, many models and remote sensing products continue to improve their spatiotemporal resolution of soil moisture, with some land surface models reaching 1\,km resolution. However, the reliability and accuracy of both modeled and remotely sensed soil moisture require comparison with ground measurements at the appropriate spatiotemporal scales. One promising technique is the cosmic ray neutron probe. Here we further assess the suitability of this technique for real-time monitoring across a large area by combining data from three fixed probes and roving surveys over a 12\,km\,{\texttimes}\,12\,km area in eastern Nebraska. Regression analyses indicated linear relationships between the fixed probe averages and roving estimates of soil moisture for each grid cell, allowing us to derive an 8\,h product at spatial resolutions of 1, 3, and 12\,km, with root-mean-square error of 3\%, 1.8\%, and 0.9\%.           ,              Key Points                                                                Combine fixed and roving cosmic ray neutron soil moisture data sets                                                     Data merging techniques to design soil moisture network at different scales                                                     Soil moisture network can provide spatiotemporal data and stats for downscaling},

The equation is based on the assumption that the shape of the soil-water characteristic curve is dependent upon the pore-size distribution of the soil (i.e., the desaturation is a function of the pore-size distribution). The equation has the form of an integrated frequency distribution curve.

  abstract = {A root pressure probe was employed to measure hydraulic properties of primary roots of maize (Zea mays L.). The hydraulic conductivity (Lp,) of intact root segments was determined by applying gradients of hydrostatic and osmotic pressure across the root cylinder. In hydrostatic experiments, Lp, was constant along the segment except for an apical zone of approximately 20 millimeters in length which was hydraulically isolated due to a high axial resistance. In osmotic experiments, Lp, decreased toward the base of the roots. Lp, (osmotic) was significantly smaller than Lp, (hydrostatic). At various distances from the root tip, the axial hydraulic resistance per unit root length (Rx) was measured either by perfusing excised root segments or was estimated according to Poiseuille's law from cross-sections. The calculated RX was smaller than the measured RX by a factor of 2 to 5. Axial resistance varied with the distance from the apex due to the differentiation of early metaxylem vessels. Except for the apical 20 millimeters, radial water movement was limiting water uptake into the root. This is important for the evaluation of Lp, of roots from root pressure relaxations. Stationary water uptake into the roots was modeled using measured values of axial and radial hydraulic resistances in order to work out profiles of axial water flow and xylem water potentials.},

  abstract = {In the context of a recent massive increase into research on plant root functions and their impact on the environment, root ecologists currently face many important challenges to keep on producing cutting edge, meaningful and integrated knowledge. Consideration of the belowground components in plant and ecosystem studies has been consistently called for in recent decades, but methodology is disparate and sometimes inappropriate. This handbook, based on the collective effort of a large team of experts, is to be used not only as starting point by students and scientists who desire working on belowground ecosystems but also by confirmed experts for consolidating and broadening their views on root ecology. Beyond the classical compilation of measurement protocols, we have synthesized recommendations from the literature to provide key background knowledge useful for (i) defining belowground entities and giving keys for their meaningful dissection, classification and naming beyond the classical fine- versus coarse-root approach, (ii) considering the specificity of root research to produce sound laboratory and field data, (iii) describing typical but overlooked steps for studying roots, e.g. root handling, cleansing and storage, and (iv) gathering of meta-data necessary for the interpretation of results and their re-use. Most importantly, all root traits have been introduced with some degree of ecological context that will be a foundation for understanding their ecological meaning, their typical use and uncertainties, and some methodological and conceptual perspectives for future research. Considering all of this, we urge readers to not solely extract protocol recommendations for trait measurements from this monograph, but take a moment to sit down, read and reflect on the extensive information contained in this broader guide to root ecology, including parts I to VII and the many introductions to each section and root trait description. Finally, it is critical to understand that a major aim of this guide is to help break down barriers between the many subdisciplines of root ecology and ecophysiology, broaden researchers' views on the multiple aspects of root study and create favourable conditions for the inception of comprehensive experiments on the role of roots in plant and ecosystem functioning.},

However, despite substantial progress made regarding plant belowground components, we are still only beginning to explore the complex relationships between root traits and functions. Drawing on the literature in plant physiology, ecophysiology, ecology, agronomy and soil science, we reviewed 24 aspects of plant and ecosystem functioning and their relationships with a number of root system traits, including aspects of architecture, physiology, morphology, anatomy, chemistry, biomechanics and biotic interactions. Based on this assessment, we critically evaluated the current strengths and gaps in our knowledge, and identify future research challenges in the field of root ecology. Most importantly, we found that belowground traits with the broadest importance in plant and ecosystem functioning are not those most commonly measured. Also, the estimation of trait relative importance for functioning requires us to consider a more comprehensive range of functionally relevant traits from a diverse range of species, across environments and over time series. We also advocate that establishing causal hierarchical links among root traits will provide a hypothesis-based framework to identify the most parsimonious sets of traits with the strongest links on functions, and to link genotypes to plant and ecosystem functioning.},

The water content and electrical conductivity of a soil solution are indeed the major factors affecting its apparent electrical conductivity, which justifies the assessment of salinity from apparent EC measurements. However, the ECa(ECw, {\texttheta}) relationship depends on some additional soil and environmental attributes affecting the soil ECa. Non-spherical particle shapes and a broad particle-size distribution tend to decrease ECa, and when non-spherical particles have some preferential alignment in space, the soil becomes anisotropic, i.e., its ECa depends on the direction in which it is measured. The electrical conductance of adsorbed counterions constitutes a major contribution to the ECa of medium- and fine-textured soils, especially under conditions of low solution conductivity. In such soils and with such salinity levels, the temperature response of the soil ECa should be stronger than that of its free solution, and care should be taken when extrapolating from field-measured ECa values to obtain the ECa at a given temperature. The above-mentioned and other secondary findings should, on one hand, indicate some limitations for the application of existing ECa--ECw models, and, on the other hand, can serve as guidelines for further development of such essential models.},

In the light of rapid progress in plant biology during the past decade, the assumption that electrical signals do not only trigger rapid leaf movements in `sensitive' plants such as Mimosa pudica or Dionaea muscipula, but also physiological processes in ordinary plants proved to be correct. Summarizing recent progress in the field of electrical signalling in plants, the present review will focus on the generation and propagation of various electrical signals, their ways of transmission within the plant body and various physiological effects.},

  abstract = {Rising prices of agricultural commodities have renewed concerns about constraints to agricultural productivity. To assess productivity trends, total factor productivity (TFP) is generally preferred to partial productivity indexes as an indicator of technical and efficiency changes because it is more closely related to the unit costs of production. But measuring TFP is demanding of data, and developing comprehensive and comparable indexes of international agricultural TFP has been challenging. This study proposes a growth accounting approach, using FAO data on quantity changes in inputs and outputs and aggregating input changes using cost shares derived from other sources, as a consistent way of constructing agricultural TFP indexes for world agriculture. This produces aggregate growth rates for agricultural output, input and TFP at the country, regional and global levels. Results suggest that the rate of agricultural TFP growth accelerated in recent decades, especially in developing countries. Most regions of the world now rely on productivity-based growth rather than resource-based growth to raise agricultural output.},

  abstract = {The analytic element method is used to investigate the spatial sensitivity of different electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) arrays. By defining the sensitivity of an array to a subsurface location we were able to generate maps showing the distribution of the sensitivity throughout the subsurface. This allows us to define regions of the subsurface where different ERT arrays are most and least sensitive. We compared the different arrays using the absolute value of the sensitivity and using its spatial distribution. Comparison is presented for three commonly used arrays (Wenner, Schlumberger, and double dipole) and for one atypical array (partially overlapping). Most common monitoring techniques use a single measurement to measure a property at a single location. The spatial distribution of the property is determined by interpolation of these measurements. In contrast, ERT is unique in that multiple measurements are interpreted simultaneously to create maps of spatially distributed soil properties. We define the spatial sensitivity of an ERT survey to each location on the basis of the sum of the sensitivities of the single arrays composing the survey to that location. With the goal of applying ERT for timelapse measurements, we compared the spatial sensitivities of different surveys on a per measurement basis. Compared are three surveys based on the typical Wenner, Schlumberger, and double dipole arrays, one atypical survey based on the partially overlapping array, and one mixed survey built of arrays that have been shown to be optimal for a series of single perturbations. Results show the inferiority of the double dipole survey compared with other surveys. On a per measurement basis, there was almost no difference between the Wenner and the Schlumberger surveys. The atypical partially overlapping survey is superior to the typical arrays. Finally, we show that a survey composed of a mixture of array types is superior to all of the single array type surveys. By analyzing the spatial sensitivity of the single array, and most significantly the sensitivity of the ERT survey, we set the basis for quantitative measurement of subsurface properties using ERT, with applications to both static and transient hydrologic processes.},

Quantitative inference about the Earth's interior from experimental data is, however, an ill-posed problem. Using the generalised McNeill's theory for the EM38 ground conductivity meter, we generated synthetic apparent conductivity curves (input data vector) simulating measurements at different heights above the soil surface. The electrical conductivity profile (the Earth model) was then estimated solving a least squares problem with Tikhonov regularization optimised with a projected conjugate gradient algorithm. Although the Tikhonov approach improves the conditioning of the resulting linear system, profile reconstruction can be surprisingly far from the desired true one. On the contrary, the projected conjugate gradient provided the best solution without any explicit regularization (a= 0) of the objective function of the least squares problem. Also, if the initial guess belongs to the image of the system matrix, Im(A), we found that it provides a unique solution in the same subspace Im(A).},

  abstract = {In the two decades following its initial release, SQLite has become the most widely deployed database engine in existence. Today, SQLite is found in nearly every smartphone, computer, web browser, television, and automobile. Several factors are likely responsible for its ubiquity, including its in-process design, standalone codebase, extensive test suite, and cross-platform file format. While it supports complex analytical queries, SQLite is primarily designed for fast online transaction processing (OLTP), employing row-oriented execution and a B-tree storage format. However, fueled by the rise of edge computing and data science, there is a growing need for efficient in-process online analytical processing (OLAP). DuckDB, a database engine nicknamed "the SQLite for analytics", has recently emerged to meet this demand. While DuckDB has shown strong performance on OLAP benchmarks, it is unclear how SQLite compares. Furthermore, we are aware of no work that attempts to identify root causes for SQLite's performance behavior on OLAP workloads. In this paper, we discuss SQLite in the context of this changing workload landscape. We describe how SQLite evolved from its humble beginnings to the full-featured database engine it is today. We evaluate the performance of modern SQLite on three benchmarks, each representing a different flavor of in-process data management, including transactional, analytical, and blob processing. We delve into analytical data processing on SQLite, identifying key bottlenecks and weighing potential solutions. As a result of our optimizations, SQLite is now up to 4.2X faster on SSB. Finally, we discuss the future of SQLite, envisioning how it will evolve to meet new demands and challenges.},

To protect water resources and their integrity for future use and to improve biodiversity, besides following advanced deficit irrigation strategies in fruit cultivation, attention could well be directed towards what are at present underused plant materials able to withstand deficit irrigation with minimum impact on yield and fruit quality. To this end, the state of the art as regards deficit irrigation strategies and the response of some very interesting emerging fruit crops [jujube (Zizyphus jujuba Mill.), loquat (Eriobotrya japonica Lindl.), pistachio (Pistacia vera L.) and pomegranate (Punica granatum L.)] are reviewed. The strengths and weaknesses of deficit irrigation strategies and the mechanisms developed by these emerging fruit crops in the face of water stress are discussed. The response of these crops to deficit irrigation, with special attention paid to the effect on yield but also on fruit quality and health-related chemical compounds, was analysed in order to assess their suitability for saving water in Mediterranean semiarid agrosystems and to analyze their potential role as alternatives to currently cultivated fruit crops with higher water requirements. Finally, the factors involved in establishing an identity brand (hydroSOS) to protect fruits obtained under specific DI conditions are discussed.},

  abstract = {The importance of applying unsaturated soil mechanics to geotechnical engineering design has been well understood. However, the consumption of time and the necessity for a specific laboratory testing apparatus when measuring unsaturated soil properties have limited the application of unsaturated soil mechanics theories in practice. Although methods for predicting unsaturated soil properties have been developed, the verification of these methods for a wide range of soil types is required in order to increase the confidence of practicing engineers in using these methods. In this study, a new permeameter was developed to measure the hydraulic conductivity of unsaturated soils using the steady-state method and directly measured suction (negative pore-water pressure) values. The apparatus is instrumented with two tensiometers for the direct measurement of suction during the tests. The apparatus can be used to obtain the hydraulic conductivity function of sandy soil over a low suction range (0--10 kPa). Firstly, the repeatability of the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity measurement, using the new permeameter, was verified by conducting tests on two identical sandy soil specimens and obtaining similar results. The hydraulic conductivity functions of the two sandy soils were then measured during the drying and wetting processes of the soils. A significant hysteresis was observed when the hydraulic conductivity was plotted against the suction. However, the hysteresis effects were not apparent when the conductivity was plotted against the volumetric water content. Furthermore, the measured unsaturated hydraulic conductivity functions were compared with predictions using three different predictive methods that are widely incorporated into numerical software. The results suggest that these predictive methods are capable of capturing the measured behavior with reasonable agreement.},

  abstract = {The use of biochar as a soil amendment attracts increasing research interest. However, the lack of methods to detect and monitor biochar in situ limits the validation of the field-scale application of biochar. Spectral induced polarization is a potential tool to characterise biochar in soil. The aim of this study is to investigate the sensitivity of spectral induced polarization to biochar in sand and to understand how the physicochemical properties of both the biochar and the surrounding matrix influence the spectral induced polarization response. To this end, spectral induced polarization measurements were conducted on four types of biochar with different mass fractions disseminated in saturated sand as a host media with changing electrical conductivity. In addition, it was investigated how the spectral induced polarization response depends on the particle size of biochar. The measured SIP data were interpreted by Debye decomposition to obtain values for the peak relaxation time, {$\tau$}peak; total chargeability, M; and normalised total chargeability, Mn. Spectral induced polarization showed a clear and specifically differentiated response to the presence of all four types of biochars. M was found to be proportional to the mass fraction of biochars, although relationships varied for each type of biochars. {$\tau$}peak of biochars increased with increasing particle size. Increased electrolyte concentration enhanced Mn for all biochars, although again, the specific response was different for each biochar. In addition, higher electrolyte concentrations decreased {$\tau$}peak for biochars derived from wood through pyrolysis but did not affect {$\tau$}peak of biochar derived from miscanthus through hydrothermal carbonisation. It was concluded that the spectral induced polarization response of pyrolytic biochars resembled that of conductors or semiconductors, whereas the spectral induced polarization response of hydrothermal carbonisation biochar more closely resembled that of clay. Overall, the findings in this study suggest that spectral induced polarization is a promising method for the detection and characterisation of biochar in soil.},

The power of this parameter, as a descriptor of ln Ksat, was tested on a database larger than 19 000 soils. Bootstrap analysis yielded coefficients of determination of up to 0.977 for ln Ksat using a triplet that combines very coarse, coarse, medium, and fine sand as coarse particles; very fine sand, and silt as intermediate particles; and clay as fine particles. The power of the correlation was analysed for different textural classes and different triplets using a bootstrap approach. Also, it is noteworthy that soils with finer textures had worse correlations, as their hydraulic properties are not solely dependent on soil PSD.},

We investigated the potential and limitations of electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) to measure three-dimensional soil moisture changes and variability in a large, undisturbed, cropped soil column and examined the interactions between soil and root system. Our analysis sustained the value of ERT as a tool to monitor and quantify water contents and water content changes in the soil, as long as the root biomass does not influence the observed resistivity. This is shown using a global water mass balance and a local validation using time domain reflectometry (TDR) probes. The observed soil moisture variability was rather high compared to values reported in the literature for bare soil. The measured water depletion rate, being the result of combined effects of root water uptake and soil water redistribution, was compared with the evaporative demand and root length densities. We observed a gradual downward movement of the maximum water depletion rate combined with periods of redistribution when there was less transpiration. Finally, the maximum root length density was observed at -70 cm depth, pointing out that root architecture can strongly depend on soil characteristics and states.},

This results in the need to use less water and fertilizer, and to harness soil quality. Key to achieving this goal is improving the understanding of processes and interactions governing the soil--plant--atmosphere continuum of agricultural ecosystems. Geophysical tools have great potential to better characterize and quantify these processes noninvasively from the plot to landscape scale. Nevertheless, a number of challenges remain for geophysical results to be better exploited by different scientific communities and by decision-makers. In this special section, we explore ongoing research in the relatively new field of agrogeophysics, and we provide an overview of potential applications and highlight future research needs.           ,              Core Ideas                                                                Geophysical techniques are future tools for sustainable management of water and nutrients in agroecosystems.                                                     Spatial electromagnetic data help to characterize large areas and to understand underlying processes.                                                     Geophysical characterization offers insights in processes driving the soil--plant--atmosphere continuum.                                                     Geophysics to characterize root properties and processes is a growing interdisciplinary research topic.},

  abstract = {Oxygen isotope compositions of precipitation and soil water from profiles at six sites near Hanover, NH reveal information about rates and mechanisms of soil water movement. The 18O-enrichment of shallow ({$<$} 20 cm depth) soil water, observed in most soil profiles, is probably due to evaporation. Isotopic fronts observed shortly after a relatively large, low-18O rainfall event suggest piston-type flow in the shallow soil accompanied by significant mixing with stationary soil water. In contrast, deep ({$>$}50 cm depth) soil water is only replaced during snowmelt or by substantial rainfall events and so residence times of this water can be several months or more. There is evidence that some of the water from smaller rainfall events bypasses the deep soil through preferential flow paths. A comparison of profiles from two sites on the same hill with different soil textures and moisture contents suggests that the proportion of immobile soil water and thus the amount of preferential flow can vary on a small scale depending on local soil characteristics. The observed soil water processes may have significant effects on plant water use, which is relevant for interpretations of isotopic tree-ring data as a record of paleoclimate.},

  abstract = {A one-dimensional dual-porosity model has been developed for the purpose of studying variably saturated water flow and solute transport in structured soils or fractured rocks. The model involves two overlaying continua at the macroscopic level: a macropore or fracture pore system and a less permeable matrix pore system. Water in both pore systems is assumed to be mobile. Variably saturated water flow in the matrix as well as in the fracture pore system is described with the Richards' equation, and solute transport is described with the convection-dispersion equation. Transfer of water and solutes between the two pore regions is simulated by means of first-order rate equations. The mass transfer term for solute transport includes both convective and diffusive components. The formulation leads to two coupled systems of nonlinear partial differential equations which were solved numerically using the Galerkin finite element method. Simulation results demonstrate the complicated nature of solute leaching in structured, unsaturated porous media during transient water flow. Sensitivity studies show the importance of having accurate estimates of the hydraulic conductivity near the surface of soil aggregates or rock matrix blocks. The proposed model is capable of simulating preferential flow situations using parameters which can be related to physical and chemical properties of the medium.},

  abstract = {Carbonate mud represents one of the most important geochemical archives for reconstructing ancient climatic, environmental, and evolutionary change from the rock record. Mud also represents a major sink in the global carbon cycle. Yet, there remains no consensus about how and where carbonate mud is formed. Here, we present stable isotope and trace-element data from carbonate constituents in the Bahamas, including ooids, corals, foraminifera, and algae. We use geochemical fingerprinting to demonstrate that carbonate mud cannot be sourced from the abrasion and mixture of any combination of these macroscopic grains. Instead, an inverse Bayesian mixing model requires the presence of an additional aragonite source. We posit that this source represents a direct seawater precipitate. We use geological and geochemical data to show that ``whitings'' are unlikely to be the dominant source of this precipitate and, instead, present a model for mud precipitation on the bank margins that can explain the geographical distribution, clumped-isotope thermometry, and stable isotope signature of carbonate mud. Next, we address the enigma of why mud and ooids are so abundant in the Bahamas, yet so rare in the rest of the world: Mediterranean outflow feeds the Bahamas with the most alkaline waters in the modern ocean ({$>$}99.7th-percentile). Such high alkalinity appears to be a prerequisite for the nonskeletal carbonate factory because, when Mediterranean outflow was reduced in the Miocene, Bahamian carbonate export ceased for 3-million-years. Finally, we show how shutting off and turning on the shallow carbonate factory can send ripples through the global climate system.},

  abstract = {Induced polarization measurements can be used to image alteration at the scale of volcanic edifices to a depth of few kilometers. Such a goal cannot be achieved with electrical conductivity alone, because too many textural and environmental parameters influence the electrical conductivity of volcanic rocks. We investigate the spectral induced polarization measurements (complex conductivity) in the frequency band 10 mHz--45 kHz of 85 core samples from five volcanoes: Merapi and Papandayan in Indonesia (32 samples), Furnas in Portugal (5 samples), Yellowstone in the USA (26 samples), and Whakaari (White Island) in New Zealand (22 samples). This collection of samples covers not only different rock compositions (basaltic andesite, andesite, trachyte and rhyolite), but also various degrees of alteration. The specific surface area is found to be correlated to the cation exchange capacity (CEC) of the samples measured by the cobalthexamine method, both serving as rough proxies of the hydrothermal alteration experienced by these materials. The in-phase (real) conductivity of the samples is the sum of a bulk contribution associated with conduction in the pore network and a surface conductivity that increases with alteration. The quadrature conductivity and the normalized chargeability are two parameters related to the polarization of the electrical double layer coating the minerals of the volcanic rocks. Both parameters increase with the degree of alteration. The surface conductivity, the quadrature conductivity, and the normalized chargeability (defined as the difference between the in-phase conductivity at high and low frequencies) are linearly correlated to the CEC normalized by the bulk tortuosity of the pore space. The effects of temperature and pyrite-content are also investigated and can be understood in terms of a physics-based model. Finally, we performed a numerical study of the use of induced polarization to image the normalized chargeability of a volcanic edifice. Induced polarization tomography can be used to map alteration of volcanic edifices with applications to geohazard mapping.},

  abstract = {Electric potential has been monitored since December 2003 in the roots and at two circumferences and one vertical profile in a standing poplar (Populus nigra). Electric potential is sampled using 6 mm diameter stainless steel rods, inserted 5 mm deep in the sapwood and is referenced to an unpolarisable lead/lead chloride electrode installed 80 cm deep in the soil. Diurnal variations are observed with seasonal differences. During winter, diurnal variations depend on the measurement point, with variable amplitudes and sometimes anti-correlations between electrodes. By contrast, a stable and coherent organisation is established in the spring, with larger amplitudes, and lasts during summer. Dedicated experiments have been performed to rule out a direct effect of temperature on the electrodes, and thus, demonstrate a genuine electrical source in the tree. Daily electrical variations have been reported previously, and have been interpreted as electrokinetic effects associated with sap flow. However, a comparison of the electrical signals with a direct measurement of the sap flow by a continuous heat flow method, shows that the electrical variation, although clearly correlated to sap flow, is not simply proportional to it. In a living system, electrokinetic effects, in addition to thermoelectrical effects, are probably modified significantly by additional electrochemical effects, such as membrane diffusion potentials, ion active transport by proteins or action potentials. Electric potential variations in trees may thus, reveal physical mechanisms in living systems not accessible by other methods. A better understanding of the electrical response of trees associated with sap flow may improve the knowledge of transfer processes between the soil and the atmosphere. This is important for the understanding of adaptive response of trees, the modelling of water and carbon balance in relation to climate change, and the quantification of the contribution of trees to the migration, retention and dispersion of contaminants. \# 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

  abstract = {Abstract. When scientists apply Archie's first law they often include an extra parameter a, which was introduced about 10~years after the equation's first publication by Winsauer et al.~(1952), and which is sometimes called the ``tortuosity'' or ``lithology'' parameter. This parameter is not, however, theoretically justified. Paradoxically, the Winsauer et al.~(1952) form of Archie's law often performs better than the original, more theoretically correct version. The difference in the cementation exponent calculated from these two forms of Archie's law is important, and can lead to a misestimation of reserves by at least 20\,\% for typical reservoir parameter values. We have examined the apparent paradox, and conclude that while the theoretical form of the law is correct, the data that we have been analysing with Archie's law have been in error. There are at least three types of systematic error that are present in most measurements: (i)~a porosity error, (ii)~a pore fluid salinity error, and (iii)~a temperature error. Each of these systematic errors is sufficient to ensure that a non-unity value of the parameter~a is required in order to fit the electrical data well. Fortunately, the inclusion of this parameter in the fit has compensated for the presence of the systematic errors in the electrical and porosity data, leading to a value of cementation exponent that is correct. The exceptions are those cementation exponents that have been calculated for individual core plugs. We make a number of recommendations for reducing the systematic errors that contribute to the problem and suggest that the value of the parameter~a may now be used as an indication of data quality.},

This paper describes the extension of the concepts of connectedness and conservation of connectedness that underlie the generalized Archie's law for n phases to the interpretation of the saturation exponent. It is shown that the saturation exponent as defined originally by Archie arises naturally from the generalized Archie's law. In the generalized Archie's law the saturation exponent of any given phase can be thought of as formally the same as the phase (i.e. cementation) exponent, but with respect to a reference subset of phases in a larger n-phase medium. Furthermore, the connectedness of each of the phases occupying a reference subset of an n-phase medium can be related to the connectedness of the subset itself by Gi\,=\,GrefSini. This leads naturally to the idea of the term Sini for each phase i being a fractional connectedness, where the fractional connectednesses of any given reference subset sum to unity in the same way that the connectednesses sum to unity for the whole medium. One of the implications of this theory is that the saturation exponent of any phase can be now be interpreted as the rate of change of the fractional connectedness with saturation and connectivity within the reference subset.},

  abstract = {Locating Dense Non-Aqueous Phase Liquids (DNAPLs) is often a bottleneck for the successful remediation and/or control of polluted sites. Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) between boreholes can detect DNAPLs because of their high electrical resistivity. In applying ERT the definition of the `best' measurement schedule is a poorly resolved problem. In two case studies, and with synthetic modeling, the cross-hole tripole-pole electrode configuration is compared with the more widely used circulating dipole-dipole and cross-hole dipole-dipole electrode configurations. The case studies involved ERT measurements between five boreholes at two polluted sites with unconsolidated sediments in the Netherlands. The outcome of the modeled data and the field data show that a cross-hole tripole-pole electrode configuration is more effective in locating DNAPLs than the other configurations. The tomographic image from the cross-hole tripole-pole configuration shows clear horizontal patterns that are in accordance with the sediment layers of the subsoil. The locations of the DNAPLs as indicated by the ERT measurements have been confirmed with groundwater samples. Still, the interpretation of the tomographic images should be done with care because ERT cannot distinguish DNAPLs from other high resistivity objects (e.g., massive building blocks) and in the top of some of the images high-resistivity computational artifacts are present that could be mistaken for DNAPLs. An important practical advantage of the cross-hole tripole-pole configuration is that the number of measurement points, and thus the measurement time, is less than half that of the other configurations.},

  abstract = {Traditional sheep and cattle grazing in natural semiarid Mediterranean, Asian and African regions is based on night corrals, where animal secretions accumulate. Lack of management and disregard for the long-term effects of using the same sites for corrals on underground soil characters may negatively affect soil values. This locally increases the content of organic matter and nutrients such as nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus and others that are stockpiled in the corrals. As these activities are long-lasting, they affect the soil parameters, leading to nutrient leakage and contamination of the upper and sub-soil surface. This alarming situation demands a technique to reveal and estimate sub-soil contamination in corrals by using the frequency domain electromagnetic method (FDEM) for measuring soil salinity. The aim of this study is to correlate electrical conductivity measurement with the FDEM to study the influence of sheep corrals on the changes within the sub-soils of corrals in the semiarid region of the northern Negev desert. The results show that a correlation was found between the laboratory soil analysis and the electromagnetic analysis in all sites. Plugot forest site results found to be anomalous indicated sub-surface conductivity resulting from the presence of the corral, with a higher conductivity value of about 230 mS/m, while no differences were found between the soil layers outside the active corral and the corral edge. High values were found in the center of the active corral: 960 mS/m by the laboratory analysis and 200 mS/m by the FDEM. The values obtained in the abandoned corral in the laboratory were about 10 times lower than those obtained from the active corral and six times lower that those found with the FDEM. At the Beit Nir site, high values were found in the center of the active corral: 300 mS/m by the laboratory analysis and 130 mS/m by the FDEM. With different sources of manure, cattle and sheep have shown similar patterns of electrical conductivity (EC) obtained in the sub-soil layers between active and abandoned corrals: high in the center and low at the edge and outside the corral and decreased with depth.},

  abstract = {Respiration is directly related to the metabolic activity of a microbial population. Micro-organisms respire at higher rates in the presence of large amounts of bioavailable organic matter while respiration rate is slower if this type of material is scarce. In the composting process respiration activity has become an important parameter for the determination of the stability of compost. It is also used for the monitoring of the composting process and it is considered an important factor for the estimation of the maturity of the material. A wide range of respirometric protocols has been reported based either on CO               2               production, O               2               uptake or release of heat. The most common methods are those based on O               2               uptake. Respirometric assays are affected by a number of parameters including temperature, humidity, and both incubation and pre-incubation conditions. Results from respirometries are generally expressed as `respiration indices', most of them with their own units and basis. In consequence, some confusion exists when referring and comparing respiration indices. This is particularly important because current and future legislations define and measure the biological stability of waste on the basis of respiration activity of the material. This paper discusses and compares most common respiration indices currently used.},

The cultivation of tree crops in rain limited Mediterranean areas depend on an adequate management of water balance that, been historically mostly based on bare soil, has created severe erosion and offsite contamination problems. Temporary cover crops can be an alternative to control these problems with a larger effect on erosion control than on reducing runoff, and a moderate impact on soil properties. This impact depend strongly on the ability to implement temporary cover crops that achieve a significant development during the rainy season while simultaneously minimizing the competition for soil water with the major crop, which is not always easy in commercial farms. This balance between soil protection and yield has been achieved in some conditions but not in others, and a significant reduction in yield has been reported for some situations. This potential risk of yield decrease, combine with the difficulty to see a collapse in yield due to soil degradation by water erosion in the short/ medium term can explain, partially, the reluctance of farmers for an extensive use of temporary cover crops. The development of improved strategies for using temporary cover crops which could include the use of water balance models, new varieties better adapted to the region, and strategies for restoring ground cover in severely degraded orchards seems to be necessary, coupled with regulations and incentive to their use by farmers. Future research should focus in the less understood elements of this system, among them root development, biomass production, phenology under different microclimate of the cover crops and the main tree crops, use of cover crops mixes, which are hampering the tuning of the system for specific conditions. It is also necessary a better definition and measurement of the impacts of cover crops on biodiversity that should be related to the landscape conditions.},

  abstract = {Estimation of groundwater recharge is considered crucial for the management of groundwater resources. The groundwater level fluctuation (GLF) method is a widely used approach to estimate groundwater recharge due to its simplicity and ease of implementation. However, the main source of uncertainty is the specific yield for the GLF method. Although there have been a lot of methods for determining specific yield, the performance of specific yield on the estimation of recharge remains unclear. We set up three lysimeters with different water table depths in the Guanzhong Basin, China. Soil moisture content along with the soil profile, water table depths, and rainfall data were measured continuously. These data provide us with accurately observed recharge and allow us to analyze the performance of specific yields from different methods in estimating recharge. The main results are: (1) The constant specific yield from the pumping tests, which is equal to the ultimate specific yield, significantly overestimated the observed recharge rates independent of water table depths. (2) The constant specific yield obtained from saturated soil moisture content minus field capacity tended to overestimate recharge under the shallow water table depths (less than 2 m), and vice versa; (3) The depth-dependent specific yield using the measured soil moisture content along with soil profile can obtain reliable recharge across all water table depths. (4) The accuracy of the depth-dependent specific yield obtained by the soil water retention curve relies on reliable parameters. The parameters {$\alpha$} and n have to be taken into account carefully for determing the specific yield. Our results are important for the application of the GLF method to estimate recharge. More importantly, it is valuable for the sustainable management of groundwater recourses.},

We review the current theory and identify six expectations for scale dependence in the BEF relationship: (1) a nonlinear change in the slope of the BEF relationship with spatial scale; (2) a scale-dependent relationship between ecosystem stability and spatial extent; (3) coexistence within and among sites will result in a positive BEF relationship at larger scales; (4) temporal autocorrelation in environmental variability affects species turnover and thus the change in BEF slope with scale; (5) connectivity in metacommunities generates nonlinear BEF and stability relationships by affecting population synchrony at local and regional scales; (6) spatial scaling in food web structure and diversity will generate scale dependence in ecosystem functioning. We suggest directions for synthesis that combine approaches in metaecosystem and metacommunity ecology and integrate cross-scale feedbacks. Tests of this theory may combine remote sensing with a generation of networked experiments that assess effects at multiple scales. We also show how anthropogenic land cover change may alter the scaling of the BEF relationship. New research on the role of scale in BEF will guide policy linking the goals of managing biodiversity and ecosystems.},

The electrical properties of trees may influence their response to atmospheric conditions and potentially lethal phenomena (e.g., lightning). We review the literature describing electrical properties of trees and provide a tabular summary of the methods and goals of each study. We hypothesized that electrical resistivity varies consistently among species and between growth forms. We surveyed resistivity of eight tree and three vine species in Michigan and Kentucky, and we quantified resistivity over a moisture gradient for wood blocks of four tree species. Resistivity varied predictably with stem diameter and differed among species and growth forms. Specifically, resistivity of trees was approximately 200\% higher than resistivity of vines, and resistivity of conifers was 135\% higher than that of hardwoods. The regional comparison showed no difference in resistivity of red maple (Acer rubrum L.) and sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) between Michigan and Kentucky. These results, in combination with interspecific differences observed among wood blocks, suggest that there is a phylogenetic basis for variation in resistivity that reflects differences in anatomy and physiology. Our review and empirical survey provide a framework for studying the ecological effects of lightning in the context of the electrical properties of trees.},

Wine is a fermented natural product, and the vineyard serves as a key point of entry for quality-modulating microbiota, particularly in wine fermentations that are conducted without the addition of exogenous yeasts. Thus, the sources and persistence of wine-relevant microbiota in vineyards critically impact its quality. Site-specific variations in microbiota within and between vineyards may contribute to regional wine characteristics. This includes distinctions in microbiomes and microbiota at the strain level, which can contribute to wine flavor and aroma, supporting the role of microbes in the accepted notion of terroir as a biological phenomenon. Little is known about the factors driving microbial biodiversity within and between vineyards, or those that influence annual assembly of the fruit microbiome. Fruit is a seasonally ephemeral, yet annually recurrent product of vineyards, and as such, understanding the sources of microbiota in vineyards is critical to the assessment of whether or not microbial terroir persists with inter-annual stability, and is a key factor in regional wine character, as stable as the geographic distances between vineyards. This review examines the potential sources and vectors of microbiota within vineyards, general rules governing plant microbiome assembly, and how these factors combine to influence plant-microbe interactions relevant to winemaking.},

We collected densely spaced GPR travel time measurements using 900 and 450 MHz antennas and analyzed these data to estimate water content. The spatial distribution of water content across the vineyard did not change significantly with time, although the absolute water content values varied seasonally and with irrigation. The GPR estimates of water content were compared to gravimetric water content, time domain reflectometry, and soil texture measurements. The comparisons of GPR-derived estimates of water content to gravimetric water content measurements showed that the GPR estimates had a root mean square error of volumetric water content of the order of 0.01. The results from this study indicate that GPR ground waves can be used to provide noninvasive, spatially dense estimates of shallow water content over large areas and in a rapid manner.},

  abstract = {Accurate characterization of near-surface soil water content is vital for guiding agricultural management decisions and for reducing the potential negative environmental impacts of agriculture. Characterizing the near-surface soil water content can be difficult, as this parameter is often both spatially and temporally variable, and obtaining sufficient measurements to describe the heterogeneity can be prohibitively expensive. Understanding the spatial correlation of near-surface soil water content can help optimize data acquisition and improve understanding of the processes controlling soil water content at the field scale. In this study, ground penetrating radar (GPR) methods were used to characterize the spatial correlation of water content in a three acre field as a function of sampling depth, season, vegetation, and soil texture. GPR data were acquired with 450 MHz and 900 MHz antennas, and measurements of the GPR groundwave were used to estimate soil water content at four different times. Additional water content estimates were obtained using time domain reflectometry measurements, and soil texture measurements were also acquired. Variograms were calculated for each set of measurements, and comparison of these variograms showed that the horizontal spatial correlation was greater for deeper water content measurements than for shallower measurements. Precipitation and irrigation were both shown to increase the spatial variability of water content, while shallowly-rooted vegetation decreased the variability. Comparison of the variograms of water content and soil texture showed that soil texture generally had greater small-scale spatial correlation than water content, and that the variability of water content in deeper soil layers was more closely correlated to soil texture than were shallower water content measurements. Lastly, cross-variograms of soil texture and water content were calculated, and co-kriging of water content estimates and soil texture measurements showed that geophysically-derived estimates of soil water content could be used to improve spatial estimation of soil texture.},

  abstract = {Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) is extensively employed for monitoring soil water content (SWC) in agricultural fields. However, the direct impacts of roots and the indirect effects of root water uptake on soil electrical resistivity (ER) have been largely neglected. Furthermore, the application of ERT technology for precise measurements of crop roots in various conditions (such as cultivars and irrigations regimes) remains unexplored. This study, therefore, utilized buried fresh root experiments, soil pots, and field-irrigation trials with different winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars to examine the influence of fresh crop roots on ER and assess ERT's capability to characterize root uptake and the root system size. The findings from the buried root and pot experiments demonstrated that fresh root addition significantly reduced the ER of mixed soil (sand and loam are mixed in a ratio of 1:5) when the SWC was below 0.24 cm3 cm 3. However, in loam soil, fresh root addition did not significantly decrease the ER. Pot experiments revealed strong positive correlations between root surface area and soil ER (R2 = 0.78, P {$<$} 0.001), suggesting that the increase in soil ER due to root absorption greatly outweighs the reduction caused by the roots themselves. Field experiments conducted during the grain-filling phase, when root size was stable, showed significant differences in soil ER changes (defined as the difference between two consecutive ER measurements) among winter wheat cultivars in both shallow (0--40 cm) and deep (40--100 cm) soil layers under various irrigation treatments. It was observed that wheat tends to utilize deep soil moisture in later growth stages, even with sufficient water conditions. Further analysis indicated that ER changes were positively correlated (R2 {$>$} 34, n = 50) with root surface area density (RSAD) in the 0--100 cm soil layer, particularly showing a stronger correlation with RSAD in the deep soil layer compared to the shallow layer under deficit irrigation (R2=0.65 vs. R2=0.23). In conclusion, ERT effectively characterizes the differences in root water uptake as well as root system size, especially focusing on deep roots among cultivars under various irrigation regimes.},

  abstract = {When exploring subsurface environments using electromagnetic (EM) induction (EMI) tools, approximate forward-modeling methods based on a homogeneous half-space kernel have been extensively evaluated in the past. For large-scale exploration methods, such as magnetotellurics, marine EM, airborne EM, transient EM, and large offset loop-loop harmonic EM, such forward-modeling approaches are limited because the kernel depends strongly on the subsurface distribution of electrical conductivity. However, the response of small portable EMI loop-loop sensors applied in a low-induction number (LIN) context are known to be more linearly related to the true distribution of electrical conductivity. Thus, data collected using such sensors are more adapted to an approximate forward-modeling with a conductivity-independent kernel. We have evaluated the bias of such an approximate modeling for the case of portable multiconfiguration system measurements in 1D, 2D, and 3D contexts. Our result shows that the approximate approach tends to underestimate the conductivity of more conductive targets but is able to reproduce the right structural information. Compared with previous algorithms presented in the literature, we solved the approximate forward-modeling problem in the hybrid spectral-spatial domain to speed up the computation. Considering the level of accuracy in structural modeling as well as the computational efficiency of our hybrid spectral-spatial approach, we conclude that this method is especially suitable for near-surface, large-scale mapping applications in LIN environments as typically encountered in soil sciences and archaeological studies. For such applications, our approach can be implemented in rapid multichannel deconvolution procedures.},

From these distributions, we obtained the total chargeability and the peak relaxation time. We correlated these parameters with the particle mineral composition, grain size, particle content and the pore solution resistivity. We also compared the experimental data with the Wong model prediction, which was unable to explain the entire data set. The above-mentioned correlations, in conjunction with some previously published data, allowed us to formulate a new, semi-empirical model that links (1) the total chargeability with the volumetric content of the particles and the total chargeability of the host matrix and (2) the time constant with the particle mineralogy, the particle radius and the pore solution resistivity.},

We carried out laboratory experiments with six synthetic models made of sieved sand mixed with metallic particles. The purpose of this experiment was to understand what mechanism (polarization of positive and negative charge carriers within the particles or interfacial polarization) was responsible for the IP effect. Size and location of passivated zones on the particle surfaces varied from model to model. We observed a decrease of the total chargeability and relaxation time values with the increase of passivated surface. Fully passivated metallic particles showed no IP effect. These data suggest the dominant role of the interface phenomena in IP associated with metallic particles. Plain Language Summary Most people know about biophysical techniques---MRI, CT scan, X-ray, etc.---that help doctors detect anomalies (areas of sickness) in a human body. Along the same lines, geophysical techniques help geologists detect anomalies (areas rich in minerals, oil, etc.) in the ``body'' of planet Earth. One of such techniques, called the induced polarization method, has the capability to sense rocks containing disseminated particles of electrically conductive minerals. Why are these particles important? Because they are known pathfinders for a variety of objects of interest: gold deposits, oil-contaminated soils, archeological sites, etc. To properly interpret the results of the induced polarization measurements, the researchers must understand the mechanism responsible for the particles polarization. Since 1920, the scientists proposed several hypotheses, yet still nobody knows which one is correct. In this letter, we describe experiments we conducted in order to determine whether the conductive particles need to be in contact with the pore water for the polarization to occur. If the answer is ``yes,'' then the particles polarize by an electrochemical mechanism. If the answer is ``no,'' then the polarization has electrodynamic origins. We found that electrical contact was required for polarization. This conclusion strongly supports the electrochemical nature of the polarization.},

  abstract = {Electrically conductive minerals (e.g. graphite, pyrite, chalcopyrite and magnetite) occur in the various geological contexts. They might represent economic resources or serve as indicators of such resources. In addition, they can be sources of contamination of soil and groundwater. Therefore, characterization of rocks containing electrically conductive inclusions is an important task in many sectors of science and economy. We conducted laboratory measurements to study the impact of the shape, composition, size and passivation character of electrically conductive inclusions on the induced polarization (IP) parameters. This paper presents results of time-domain IP measurements performed on 22 synthetic models, which were made of sieved sand mixed with electrically conductive particles. We carried out the IP measurements while varying orientation of the electrical field relative to the long axis of the inclusions. We found that the total chargeability of the models (M) strongly depended on the volumetric content ({$\xi$} ), shape and characteristic size (l) of the inclusions. It also depended on the angle between the electrical field direction and the orientation of the long axis of the inclusions ({$\alpha$}), which made the models anisotropic. Experimental relationships between M, {$\xi$} , l and {$\alpha$} were found consistent with predictions of the generalized Maxwell--Garnett mixing equation in the tensor form. In contrast to M, the relaxation time ({$\tau$} ) of the studied models was almost independent of {$\alpha$}. Exceptions were the models with cylindrical electrically conductive particles, which showed a strong relationship between {$\tau$} and {$\alpha$}. Despite the previous assumptions, no unique relationship between {$\tau$} and the characteristic length of electrically conductive inclusions was observed. However, for all particle shapes, {$\tau$} was proportional to the surface area of the particles. We also studied how passivated areas on the surface of the inclusions modified the spectral IP parameters. We found that passivation of electrically conductive inclusions led to anisotropy of M, while {$\tau$} remained almost unaffected by the orientation of the polarizing field. Based on the experimental data, we show that the polarization magnitude of electrically conductive inclusions is proportional to the normal component of the electrical current density on their surface. We also show that the relaxation time is proportional to the area of the active surface of the inclusions. The obtained relationships highlight the importance of the interfacial polarization mechanism of the electrically conductive inclusions.},

  abstract = {Cohesion-tension transport of water is an energetically efficient way to carry large amounts of water from the roots up to the leaves. However, the cohesion-tension mechanism places the xylem water under negative hydrostatic pressure (Px), rendering it susceptible to cavitation. There are conflicts among the structural requirements for minimizing cavitation on the one hand vs maximizing efficiency of transport and construction on the other. Cavitation by freeze-thaw events is triggered by in situ air bubble formation and is much more likely to occur as conduit diameter increases, creating a direct conflict between conducting efficiency and sensitivity to freezing induced xylem failure. Temperate ring-porous trees and vines with wide diameter conduits tend to have a shorter growing season than conifers and diffuse-porous trees with narrow conduits. Cavitation by water stress occurs by air seeding at interconduit pit membranes. Pit membrane structure is at least partially uncoupled from conduit size, leading to a much less pronounced trade-off between conducting efficiency and cavitation by drought than by freezing. Although wider conduits are generally more susceptible to drought-induced cavitation within an organ, across organs or species this trend is very weak. Different trade-offs become apparent at the level of the pit membranes that interconnect neighbouring conduits. Increasing porosity of pit membranes should enhance conductance but also make conduits more susceptible to air seeding. Increasing the size or number of pit membranes would also enhance conductance, but may weaken the strength of the conduit wall against implosion. The need to avoid conduit collapse under negative pressure creates a significant trade-off between cavitation resistance and xylem construction cost, as revealed by relationships between conduit wall strength, wood density and cavitation pressure. Tradeoffs involving cavitation resistance may explain the correlations between wood anatomy, cavitation resistance, and the physiological range of negative pressure experienced by species in their native habitats.},

  abstract = {In the area of mass production, products are weighed using load cell based dynamic weighing systems. A load cell is an uncontrollable weighing device and the value of weight, for the passing product, is estimated by filtering the electrical signal from a load cell. Improvement in filtering increases the speed of weighing and enhances the measurement accuracy. In this paper a Kalman filter is proposed as a weight filter for the dynamic weighing system. Furthermore, the paper includes mathematical models of the load cell and forcing functions. These models are used to examine the suitability of the proposed Kalman filter approach. Since this approach is based on the accurate model of the system in question, the exact model of the load cell based dynamic weighing system has been derived and presented. For one particular value of the weight, the parameters of the model are time-varying due to the product coming onto the weigh-table and due to the product length. Changing the measurement from one value of the weight to another, causes even greater changes in the values of the model parameters and introduces a non-linearity in the system. Thereforc, an adaptivity approach has been considered and a solution proposed. The simulation and experimental results are presented and compared. The results achieved, show that the Kalman filter may provide effective alternative to the conventional method especially when the system is nonlinear and low frequency noise is incorporated in the bandwidth of the useful signal.},

A scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction spectrum (XRD) and BET analyses were used to observe the surface properties of the coated layer. An energy dispersive analysis of X-ray (EDAX) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used for characterizing metal adsorption sites on the surface of MOCS. The quantity of manganese on MOCS was determined by means of acid digestion analysis. The adsorption experiments were carried out as a function of solution pH, adsorbent dose, ionic strength, contact time and temperature. Binding of Cu(II) and Pb(II) ions with MOCS was highly pH dependent with an increase in the extent of adsorption with the pH of the media investigated. After the Cu(II) and Pb(II) adsorption by MOCS, the pH in solution was decreased. Cu(II) and Pb(II) uptake were found to increase with the temperature. Further, the removal efficiency of Cu(II) and Pb(II) increased with increasing adsorbent dose and decreased with ionic strength. The pseudo-first-order kinetic model, pseudo-second-order kinetic model, intraparticle diffusion model and Elovich equation model were used to describe the kinetic data and the data constants were evaluated. The pseudo-second-order model was the best choice among all the kinetic models to describe the adsorption behavior of Cu(II) and Pb(II) onto MOCS, suggesting that the adsorption mechanism might be a chemisorption process. The activation energy of adsorption (Ea) was determined as Cu(II) 4.98 kJ mol-1 and Pb(II) 2.10 kJ mol-1, respectively. The low value of Ea shows that Cu(II) and Pb(II) adsorption process by MOCS may involve a non-activated chemical adsorption and a physical sorption.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Large weighing lysimeters are currently the most precise method to directly measure all components of the terrestrial water balance in parallel via the built-in weighing system. As lysimeters are exposed to several external forces such as management practices or wind influencing the weighing data, the calculated fluxes of precipitation and evapotranspiration can be altered considerably without having applied appropriate corrections to the raw data. Therefore, adequate filtering schemes for obtaining most accurate estimates of the water balance components are required. In this study, we use data from the TERENO (TERrestrial ENvironmental Observatories) SoilCan research site in Bad Lauchst{\"a}dt to develop a comprehensive filtering procedure for high-precision lysimeter data, which is designed to deal with various kinds of possible errors starting from the elimination of large disturbances in the raw data resulting e.g., from management practices all the way to the reduction of noise caused e.g., by moderate wind. Furthermore, we analyze the influence of averaging times and thresholds required by some of the filtering steps on the calculated water balance and investigate the ability of two adaptive filtering methods (the adaptive window and adaptive threshold filter (AWAT filter; Peters et al., 2014), and a new synchro filter applicable to the data from a set of several lysimeters) to further reduce the filtering error. Finally, we take advantage of the data sets of all 18 lysimeters running in parallel at the Bad Lauchst{\"a}dt site to evaluate the performance and accuracy of the proposed filtering scheme. For the tested time interval of 2 months, we show that the estimation of the water balance with high temporal resolution and good accuracy is possible.

  abstract = {The use of frequency domain electromagnetic (FDEM) instrumentation in ground-based near-surface applications is continually expanding. In soil studies, FDEM is mainly deployed to inform on soil properties such as salinity, texture, moisture or compaction by evaluating the low induction number (LIN) apparent electrical conductivity (ECa). However, advanced FDEM applications face terrains and conditions in which these LIN approximations are no longer valid. Under such conditions, the aforementioned instrumentation output systematically underestimates ECa values; making semi-qualitative data analysis, representation and practical interpretation impossible. For this reason, methods have to be developed to relate the complex FDEM responses to a reliable ECa, beyond the limitations of the LIN approximation. In this work, we present a quadrature-phase algorithm (i.e. excluding the in-phase signal from the estimation) to obtain a robust apparent electrical conductivity at both low and high induction numbers. In addition, the algorithm classifies the ECa estimations as either robust or non-robust based on instrument noise, desired precision of the ECa estimation and the effect of subsurface magnetic variations. The algorithm accounts for electrical conductivity, instrument elevation, coil geometry, operating frequency, subsurface magnetic variation and random errors. The presented procedure, which was tested on synthetic and experimental data, consists a robust and straightforward approach to increase reliability of ECa derived soil mapping.},

  abstract = {Instantaneous electrical responses in plants have been widely studied, but the mechanism of spontaneous, periodic electric potential alternations in the xylem of tree trunks remains controversial. The generation of the electric potential can be explained by the electrode potential, which depends on ion concentrations near electrodes. However, several different hypotheses about its periodic variations have been proposed, including streaming potential, ion diffusion, charge transport, and oxygen turnover. Here, we performed long-term measurements on the electric potential and water content in the xylem of trees, and observed changes in the electric potential and transpiration rate in response to varied numbers of leaves, light radiation, temperature, and relative air humidity. The electric potential showed a distinct seasonal trend, combined with daily rhythms, and could be affected by environmental changes. Rapid changes in the electric potential routinely lagged behind those of the transpiration rate, but their ranges of change were proportional. Both annual and diurnal patterns of the electric potential were synchronous with the trees' water content. Moreover, we found potential function relationships between the electric potential and water content. Accordingly, we propose a new perspective, that the variations of the electric potential in tree xylem could be associated with water content rhythms.},

There has been a growing amount of literature measuring the impacts of individual extreme events (heat stress or water stress) on agricultural and human systems. Yet, we lack a comprehensive understanding of the significance and the magnitude of the impacts of compound extremes. This study combines a fine-scale weather product with outputs of a hydrological model to construct functional metrics of individual and compound hydroclimatic extremes for agriculture. Then, a yield response function is estimated with individual and compound metrics, focusing on corn in the United States during the 1981--2015 period. Supported by statistical evidence, the findings suggest that metrics of compound hydroclimatic extremes are better predictors of corn yield variations than metrics of individual extremes. The results also confirm that wet heat is more damaging than dry heat for corn. This study shows the average yield damage from heat stress has been up to four times more severe when combined with water stress.},

NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

The measured EC values at various temperatures need to be reported as corresponding to a standard temperature because EC is dependent on temperature. An arbitrary constant is commonly used for temperature compensation assuming that EC-temperature relation is linear (for example 2\% increase of EC per 1 {\textopenbullet}C). This paper examines the EC-temperature relation of natural waters having vastly different compositions and salinities. EC-temperature relation was slightly nonlinear in a temperature range 0--30 {\textopenbullet}C, but the linear equation approximated the relation reasonably well. The temperature compensation factor corresponding to 25 {\textopenbullet}C ranged between 0.0175 and 0.0198. When the mean value 0.0187 was used, the error of estimating EC at 25 {\textopenbullet}C from EC at 10 {\textopenbullet}C was less than about 2\% for all samples tested. Temperature compensation factors vary substantially depending on the choice of standard temperature.

Temperature variations in the near surface can produce larger magnitude changes in electrical conductivity than changes due to slow moving solute plumes or spatial variations in chemistry and soil moisture. Relationships between temperature and electrical conductivity based on previous studies conducted over 25--200{$^\circ$}C do not explain 0--25{$^\circ$}C laboratory data. A modification to the temperature dependence within a petrophysical model is proposed that may allow general application over this temperature range. An empirical linear approximation of 1.8 to 2.2 percent change in bulk electrical conductivity per degree C is consistent with low temperature electrical conductivity studies and the predictions of the petrophysical model used. This relationship can be used to account for the effect of temperature variations within individual images or time-lapse difference images.},

  abstract = {Simulating direct current resistivity, frequency domain electromagnetics and time domain electromagnetics in settings where steel cased boreholes are present is of interest across a range of applications including welllogging, monitoring subsurface injections such as hydraulic fracturing or carbon capture and storage. In some surveys, well-casings have been used as ``extended electrodes'' for near surface environmental or geotechnical applications. Wells are often cased with steel, which has both a high conductivity and a significant magnetic permeability. The large physical property contrasts as well as the large disparity in length-scales, which are introduced when a steel-cased well is in a modeling domain, makes performing an electromagnetic forward simulation challenging. Using this setting as motivation, we present a finite volume approach for modeling electromagnetic problems on cylindrically symmetric and 3D cylindrical meshes which include an azimuthal discretization. The associated software implementation includes modeling capabilities for direct current resistivity, time domain electromagnetics, and frequency domain electromagnetics for models that include variable electrical conductivity and magnetic permeability. Electric and magnetic fields, fluxes, and charges are readily accessible in any simulation so that they can be visualized and interrogated. We demonstrate the value of being able to explore the behavior of electromagnetic fields and fluxes through examples which revisit a number of foundational papers on direct current resistivity and electromagnetics in steel-cased wells. The software implementation is open source and included as a part of the SimPEG software ecosystem for simulation and parameter estimation in geophysics.},

These include applications such as monitoring of CO2 sequestration or even assessing the integrity of a wellbore. In this paper, we examine the impacts of the magnetic permeability of a steel-cased well on electromagnetic responses in grounded source experiments. We consider a vertical wellbore and simulate time and frequency domain data on 3-D cylindrical meshes. Permeability slows the decay of surface electric fields in the time domain and contributes to a phase shift in the frequency domain. We develop our understanding of how permeability alters currents within, and external to, the casing by focussing first on the time domain response and translating insights to the frequency domain. Following others, we rewrite Maxwell's equations to separate the response into terms that describe the magnetization and induction effects. Magnetic permeability impacts the responses in two ways: (1) it enhances the inductive component of the response in the casing and (2) it creates a magnetization current on the outer wall of the casing. The interaction of these two effects results in a poloidal current system within the casing. It also generates anomalous currents external to the casing that can alter the geometry and magnitude of currents in the surrounding geological formation. This has the potential to be advantageous for enhancing responses in monitoring applications.},

  abstract = {Measuring soil moisture with cosmic-ray neutrons is a promising technique for intermediate spatial scales. To convert neutron counts to average volumetric soil water content a simple calibration function can be used (the N0calibration of Desilets et al., 2010). The calibration is based on soil water content derived directly from soil samples taken within the footprint of the sensor. We installed a cosmic-ray neutron sensor (CRS) in a mixed forest in the lowlands of north-eastern Germany and calibrated it 10 times throughout one calendar year. Each calibration with the N0-calibration function resulted in a different CRS soil moisture time series, with deviations of up to 0.1 m3 m-3 (24 \% of the total range) for individual values of soil water content. Also, many of the calibration efforts resulted in time series that could not be matched with independent in situ measurements of soil water content. We therefore suggest a modified calibration function with a different shape that can vary from one location to another. A two-point calibration was found to effectively define the shape of the modified calibration function if the calibration points were taken during both dry and wet conditions spanning at least half of the total range of soil moisture. The best results were obtained when the soil samples used for calibration were linearly weighted as a function of depth in the soil profile and nonlinearly weighted as a function of distance from the CRS, and when the depth-specific amount of soil organic matter and lattice water content was explicitly considered. The annual cycle of tree foliation was found to be a negligible factor for calibration because the variable hydrogen mass in the leaves was small compared to the hydrogen mass changes by soil moisture variations. As a final point, we provide a calibration guide for a CRS in forested environments.},

The electrical self-potential (SP) method has been applied in a broad range of monitoring studies. When fluid flow is involved the most relevant source of SP is the streaming potential, caused by the flow of an electrolyte through porous media with electrically charged internal surfaces. We experimentally investigated the SP signal associated with deformation of partially saturated soil. For partly saturated scenarios, we observed an SP signature correlated with the mass movement. In dry experiments, we did not observe any significant change in the electric signal. Results of numerical simulations match with the experimental observations when assuming a local and temporary alteration of the hydraulic pressure due to the sliding mass. Our findings suggest that SP measurements can be used to observe mass movement triggered by fluid pressure variations through the streaming potential.},

An accurate and stable weight loss was achieved after 2 h of burning pure CaCO3 at 950 {$^\circ$}C, whereas LOI of pure graphite at 530 {$^\circ$}C showed a direct relation to sample size and exposure time, with only 40--70\% of the possible weight loss reached after 2 h of exposure and smaller samples losing weight faster than larger ones. Experiments with a standardised lake sediment revealed a strong initial weight loss at 550 {$^\circ$}C, but samples continued to lose weight at a slow rate at exposure of up to 64 h, which was likely the effect of loss of volatile salts, structural water of clay minerals or metal oxides, or of inorganic carbon after the initial burning of organic matter. A further test-run revealed that at 550 {$^\circ$}C samples in the centre of the furnace lost more weight than marginal samples. At 950 {$^\circ$}C this pattern was still apparent but the differences became negligible. Again, LOI was dependent on sample size.},

  abstract = {Cosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRNS) is becoming increasingly popular for monitoring soil water content (SWC). To retrieve SWC from observed neutron intensities, local measurements of SWC are typically required to calibrate a location-specific parameter, N0, in the corresponding transfer function. In this study, we develop a generalized conversion function that explicitly takes into account the different factors that govern local neutron intensity. Thus, the parameter N0 becomes location independent, i.e. generally applicable. We demonstrate the feasibility of such a ``general calibration function'' by analysing 75 CRNS sites from four recently published datasets. Given the choice between the two calibration strategies -- local or general -- users will wonder which one is preferable. To answer this question, we estimated the resulting uncertainty in the SWC by means of error propagation. While the uncertainty in the local calibration depends on both the local reference SWC itself and its error, the uncertainty in the general calibration is mainly governed by the errors in vegetation biomass and soil bulk density. Our results suggest that a local calibration -- generally considered best practice -- might often not be the best option. In order to support the decision which calibration strategy -- local or general -- is actually preferable in the user-specific application context, we provide an interactive online tool that assesses the uncertainty in both options (https://cosmic-sense.github.io/local-or-global, last access: 23 February 2024).},

The load cell was buried in a broadband noise background where the unwanted information and the relevant signal sometimes share a very similar frequency spectrum and its performance was improved by using a recursive least-squares (RLS) lattice algorithm.

  abstract = {Abstract. Accurate measurements of evapotranspiration are required for many meteorological, climatological, ecological, and hydrological research applications and developments. Here we examine and compare two well-established methods to determine evapotranspiration at the site level: lysimeter-based measurements~(EL) and eddy covariance~(EC) flux measurements~(EEC). The analyses are based on parallel measurements carried out with these two methods at the research catchment Rietholzbach in northeastern Switzerland, and cover the time period of June~2009 to December~2015. The measurements are compared on various timescales, and with respect to a 40-year lysimeter-based evapotranspiration time series. Overall, the lysimeter and EC measurements agree well, especially on the annual timescale. On that timescale, the long-term lysimeter measurements also correspond well with catchment water-balance estimates of evapotranspiration. This highlights the representativeness of the site-level lysimeter and EC measurements for the entire catchment despite their comparatively small source areas and the heterogeneous land use and topography within the catchment. Furthermore, we identify that lack of reliable EC measurements using open-path gas analyzers during and following precipitation events (due to limitations of the measurement technique under these conditions) significantly contributes to an underestimation of EEC and to the overall energy balance gap at the site.},

For a period of 418 days, precipitation was measured by a tipping bucket rain gauge installed at 1 m height, three Hellmann rain gauges placed on the ground and three lysimeters. Precipitation catch of the lysimeters showed very small deviation (b 0.5\%) and was regarded as reference. The tipping bucket at 1 m height caught 12.7\% less precipitation. By contrast, ground-level Hellmann gauges caught, on average, similar precipitation as lysimeters. Both methods exhibited large undercatch in wintertime and low undercatch (tipping bucket) or even overcatch (Hellmann gauge) in summertime. Hellmann gauge measurements at ground level allow a fairly exact determination of precipitation for long time periods with low cost and effort.},

Some large collections of SHPs, such as the UNSODA and HYPRES databases, have already existed for more than 2 decades. They have provided an essential basis for many studies related to the critical zone. Today, sample-based SHPs can be determined in a wider saturation range and with higher resolution by combining some recently developed laboratory methods. We provide 572 high-quality SHP data sets from undisturbed, mostly central European samples covering a wide range of soil texture, bulk density and organic carbon content. A consistent and rigorous quality filtering ensures that only trustworthy data sets are included. The data collection contains (i) SHP data, which consist of soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity data, determined by the evaporation method and supplemented by retention data obtained by the dewpoint method and saturated conductivity measurements; (ii) basic soil data, which consist of particle size distribution determined by sedimentation analysis and wet sieving, bulk density and organic carbon content; and (iii) metadata, which include the coordinates of the sampling locations. In addition, for each data set, we provide soil hydraulic parameters for the widely used van Genuchten--Mualem model and for the more advanced Peters--Durner--Iden model. The data were originally collected to develop and test SHP models and associated pedotransfer functions. However, we expect that they will be very valuable for various other purposes such as simulation studies or correlation analyses of different soil properties to study their causal relationships.

  abstract = {Summary Flux data are noisy, and this uncertainty is largely due to random measurement error. Knowledge of uncertainty is essential for the statistical evaluation of modeled and measured fluxes, for comparison of parameters derived by fitting models to measured fluxes and in formal data-assimilation efforts. We used the difference between simultaneous measurements from two towers located less than 1 km apart to quantify the distributional characteristics of the measurement error in fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2) and sensible and latent heat (H and LE, respectively). Flux measurement error more closely follows a double exponential than a normal distribution. The CO2 flux uncertainty is negatively correlated with mean wind speed, whereas uncertainty in H and LE is positively correlated with net radiation flux. Measurements from a single tower made 24 h apart under similar environmental conditions can also be used to characterize flux uncertainty. Uncertainty calculated by this method is somewhat higher than that derived from the two-tower approach. We demonstrate the use of flux uncertainty in maximum likelihood parameter estimates for simple physiological models of daytime net carbon exchange. We show that inferred model parameters are highly correlated, and that hypothesis testing is therefore possible only when the joint distribution of the model parameters is taken into account.},

  abstract = {Recently, encouraging results have been obtained to estimate hydraulic conductivity in unconsolidated sediments from induced polarisation (IP) measurements. The work focussed on laboratory experiments in order to establish semi-empirical relationships between complex electrical conductivity and hydraulic parameters. Although field studies are certainly important to evaluate the feasibility of the method in practice, only a limited number of case histories have been reported. We carried out an IP survey at the Krauthausen hydrogeological test site in Germany. Multifrequency data were recorded along two profiles with a dipole--dipole configuration and 2 m electrode spacing. The data were inverted with a 2-D inversion code to obtain images of conductivity magnitude and phase for each frequency. We used a novel focussing regularisation scheme that does not suppress sharp boundaries and yields realistic images of the subsurface. The gross structural features compare well with the known lithology, which consists of an approx. 9 m thick sand/gravel aquifer over fine sands and a thin clay layer which constitutes the base at approx. 11 m depth. From the complex electrical conductivity distribution we calculate hydraulic conductivity estimates using the empirical equations suggested by B{\"o}rner et al. [B{\"o}rner, F. D., Schopper J. R., Weller, A., 1996. Evaluation of transport and storage properties in the soil and groundwater zone from induced polarisation measurements. Geophys. Prosp. 44, 583--601] and by Slater and Lesmes [Slater, L. D., Lesmes, D. P., 2002a. Electric hydraulic relationships observed for unconsolidated sediments. Water Res. Research, 38 (10), doi:10.1029/2001WR001075] and compare the results with values obtained from grain size data at two boreholes. The B{\"o}rner model yields hydraulic conductivities in the same order of magnitude as the grain size data, whereas the Slater and Lesmes model substantially underestimates hydraulic conductivities. We also compare the specific inner surface estimated from our IP data with values obtained from BET measurements at the two borehole locations. In this case, we observe a reasonable agreement with both the B{\"o}rner and the Slater and Lesmes equations. Our results constitute an encouraging example where reasonable estimates of hydraulic parameters are obtained at the field scale.},

The geometry consists of a sequence of wide and narrow pores with finite radii. The charge distribution at the mineral surface is described by a triple layer model, characterized by the zeta potential and the partition coefficient. We extended an existing model by incorporating known dependencies of the zeta potential and the partition coefficient on fluid salinity and pH.},

Our analysis, based on literature review, personal inquiry, and an author survey, summarizes the main driving forces behind model diversification. We anticipate that this review not only helps researchers from other fields but in particular also the international hydrology community to understand why we have so many different streamflow models.},

  abstract = {Even though the process of plant water use under individual environmental stress conditions (drought, heat, cold, salinity, etc.) has been widely studied, the processes through which plants cope with multiple stresses (such as water stress combined with hot temperature) remain inconclusive. In the dry-hot valley region of southwest China, soil moisture, temperature, radiation and the associated stresses make complex the process of plant transpiration. To determine environmental controls on the water use of a typical orange tree in the region, sap flow was monitored in the trunks of seven orange trees, meteorological factors and soil water content were recorded between 20 May 2020, and 31 May 2022. The seasons were classified into: rainy (June--October), dry (November--February the other year), and dry-hot (March--May). Results showed that the transpiration of orange trees (Tc) in the study area was 659 mm of water per year. Compared with rainy (2.04 mm d-1) and dry (2.14 mm d-1) seasons, Tc was significantly lower during the dry-hot season (1.38 mm d-1). Rainfall had a significant impact on the transpiration process. Compared with the pre-rainfall value, Tc decreased after light rainfall events ({$<$}10 mm), but increased after heavy rainfall events ({$>$}10 mm). The variation in Tc increased initially and later gradually decreased with increasing rainfall amount. The minimum rainfall threshold that triggered an increase in Tc was 10.9 mm. Compared with the pre-rainfall days, Tc decreased for almost all types of rainfall event on rainy days. The drop in Tc was driven by the volume, time, and duration of rainfall. There was no direct correlation between Tc and most environmental factors (R2 {$<$} 0.40). However, Tc/ET0 (ET0 is grass reference evapotranspiration) was strongly correlated with the environmental factors. Net radiation (R2 = 0.61--0.73), air temperature (R2 = 0.39--0.49), daily maximum air temperature (R2 = 0.49--0.73), vapor pressure deficit (R2 = 0.34--0.45), and ET0 (R2 = 0.64--0.74) were negatively logarithmically correlated with daily Tc/ET0. However, daily Tc/ET0 was positively logarithmically correlated with VWC/ET0; R2 = 0.60--0.83 (where VWC is soil water content) and VWC/Tamax; R2 = 0.32--0.56 (where Tamax is maximum air temperature). Among the studied environmental factors, VWC/ET0 had the highest correlation with Tc/ET0 (R2 as high as 0.83). These results were critical for accurate evaluation of the effects of interaction of water and heat on plant water use. The study is therefore useful for effective water management in arid and semiarid regions. This is particularly so when concurrent hot and dry conditions were considered, likely to occur under future climatic conditions.},

  abstract = {Spectral induced polarization (SIP) phase anomalies in field surveys at contaminated sites have previously been shown to correlate with the occurrence of chemically reducing conditions and/or semiconductive minerals, but the reasons for this are not fully understood. We report a systematic laboratory investigation of the role of the semiconductive mineral magnetite and its interaction with redox-active versus redox-inactive ions in producing such phase anomalies. The SIP responses of quartz sand with 5\% magnetite in solutions containing redox-inactive [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] versus redox-active [Formula: see text] were measured across the pH ranges corresponding to adsorption of these metals to magnetite. With redox inactive ions [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text], SIP phase response showed no changes across the pH range 4--10, corresponding to their adsorption, showing [Formula: see text] anomalies peaking at [Formula: see text]--74~Hz. These large phase anomalies are probably caused by polarization of the magnetite-solution interfaces. With the redox-active ion [Formula: see text], frequency of peak phase response decreased progressively from [Formula: see text] to [Formula: see text] as effluent pH increased from four to seven, corresponding to progressive adsorption of [Formula: see text] to the magnetite surface. The latter frequency (3~Hz) corresponds approximately with those of phase anomalies detected in field surveys reported elsewhere. We conclude that pH sensitivity arises from redox reactions between [Formula: see text] and magnetite surfaces, with transfer of electrical charge through the bulk mineral, as reported in other laboratory investigations. Our results confirm that SIP measurements are sensitive to redox reactions involving charge transfers between adsorbed ions and semiconductive minerals. Phase anomalies seen in field surveys of groundwater contamination and biostimulation may therefore be indicative of iron-reducing conditions, when semiconductive iron minerals such as magnetite are present.},

The East River watershed has been developed as a ``community'' testbed.                                                                                   Extreme weather, fires, and land use and climate change are significantly reshaping interactions within watersheds throughout the world. Although hydrological--biogeochemical interactions within watersheds can impact many services valued by society, uncertainty associated with predicting hydrology-driven biogeochemical watershed dynamics remains high. With an aim to reduce this uncertainty, an approximately 300-km                 2                 mountainous headwater observatory has been developed at the East River, CO, watershed of the Upper Colorado River Basin. The site is being used as a testbed for the Department of Energy supported Watershed Function Project and collaborative efforts. Building on insights gained from research at the ``sister'' Rifle, CO, site, coordinated studies are underway at the East River site to gain a predictive understanding of how the mountainous watershed retains and releases water, nutrients, carbon, and metals. In particular, the project is exploring how early snowmelt, drought, and other disturbances influence hydrological--biogeochemical watershed dynamics at seasonal to decadal timescales. A system-of-systems perspective and a scale-adaptive simulation approach, involving the combined use of archetypal watershed subsystem ``intensive sites'' are being tested at the site to inform aggregated watershed predictions of downgradient exports. Complementing intensive site hydrological, geochemical, geophysical, microbiological, geological, and vegetation datasets are long-term, distributed measurement stations and specialized experimental and observational campaigns. Several recent research advances provide insights about the intensive sites as well as aggregated watershed behavior. The East River ``community testbed'' is currently hosting scientists from more than 30 institutions to advance mountainous watershed methods and understanding.},

First, co-located electrical tomographic tomography (ERT) and EMI datasets were compared to gain confidence about how the EMI method averaged soil properties over the grapevine rooting depth. Then, EMI data were used with core soil texture and soil-pit based interpretations of Bordeaux soil types (Brunisol, Redoxisol, Colluviosol and Calcosol) to estimate the spatial distribution of geophysically-identified Bordeaux soil classes. A strong relationship (r\,=\,0.75, p\,{$<$}\,0.01) was revealed between the geophysically-identified Bordeaux soil classes and NDVI (both 2~m resolution), showing that the highest grapevine vigor was associated with the Bordeaux soil classes having the largest clay fraction. The results suggest that within-block variability of grapevine vigor was largely controlled by variability in soil classes, and that carefully collected EMI and NDVI datasets can be exceedingly helpful for providing quantitative estimates of vineyard soil and vigor variability, as well as their covariation. The method is expected to be transferable to other viticultural regions, providing an approach to use easy-to-acquire, high resolution datasets to guide viticultural practices, including routine management and replanting.},

However, a geologist with an interest in wine is almost inevitably going to take more than a passing interest in what lies beneath vineyards. This may have resulted in the importance of the geology being over-rated. Many wine writers who are not geologists have dutifully described the geology associated with particular wine regions without actually stating how the geology is important. Jake Hancock was quick to realize that a lot of what is written about geology in wine books is at best misguided and at worst utterly wrong, and set about putting this to rights at every opportunity. Vines derive most of their nourishment from a depth extending down to 0.6 m, but will, most of the time, rely on water from down as far as 2 m for transpiration. Only during periods of drought will they draw significant water from {$>$}2 m. Clearly then, in areas where there is a deep cover of drift or a deep soil horizon, geological influence on vines will be minimal. Even where the soil is thin, geology will, in many areas where vines are grown, only control the quality of the grapes indirectly through influence on soil composition, geomorphology and water retention. These factors will be examined, together with examples of instances where geology does have a direct influence on wine quality.},

  abstract = {Broadband spectral induced polarization (SIP) measurements of the complex electrical resistivity can be affected by the contact impedance of the potential electrodes above 100 Hz. In this study, we present a correction procedure to remove electrode impedance effects from SIP measurements to improve the accuracy of broadband complex electrical resistivity measurements. The first step in this correction procedure is to estimate the electrode impedance using a measurement with reversed current and potential electrodes. In a second step, this estimated electrode impedance is used to correct SIP measurements based on a simplified electrical model of the SIP measurement system. We evaluated this new correction procedure using SIP measurements on water because of the well-defined dielectric properties. It was found that the difference between the corrected and expected phase of the complex electrical resistivity of water was below 0.1 mrad at 1 kHz for a wide range of electrode impedances. In addition, SIP measurements on a saturated unconsolidated sediment sample with two types of potential electrodes showed that the measured phase of the electrical resistivity was very similar (difference b 0.2 mrad) up to a frequency of 10 kHz after the effect of the different electrode impedances was removed. Finally, SIP measurements on variably saturated unconsolidated sand were made. Here, the plausibility of the phase of the electrical resistivity was improved for frequencies up to 1 kHz, but errors remained for higher frequencies due to the approximate nature of the electrode impedance estimates and some remaining unknown parasitic capacitances that led to current leakage. It was concluded that the proposed correction procedure for SIP measurements improved the accuracy of the phase measurements by an order of magnitude in the kHz frequency range. Further improvement of this accuracy requires a method to accurately estimate parasitic capacitances in situ.},

  abstract = {Due to the increasing demand for some metals the investigation of abandoned mine waste dumps for the potential reuse of ore mining residues becomes more important. This study examines the suitability of the spectral induced polarization (SIP) method to distinguish different ores in the mine dumps and evaluate the deposited amounts. We investigated SIP characteristics of four sulphides: pyrite (FeS 2), chalcopyrite (CuFeS2), galena (PbS) and sphalerite (ZnS). Laboratory measurements on fully saturated synthetic ore-sand-mixtures (FeS 2, PbS, ZnS) with three different grain radii (between 31 {$\mu$}m and 500 {$\mu$}m), three different ore concentrations (0.5 vol.-\%, 2 vol.-\%, 6 vol.-\%) and with different electrical conductivities of the pore fluid (between 25 mS/m and 400 mS/m, sodium chloride) for pyrite- and chalcopyrite-sand mixtures have been carried out. A new four-point sample holder for precise and reproducible measurements of the unconsolidated mineral-sand mixtures has been developed. The measurements were done at constant temperature of 20{$\circ$}C within a frequency range from 1 mHz to 45 kHz using a high-accuracy impedance spectrometer. Several trends for the induced polarization signature have been observed. First, the polarization signal increases with higher ore mineral content. Second, both phase amplitude and peak frequency increase with decreasing grain radius. Third, the frequency of the phase maximum is shifted to higher values for increasing fluid conductivity. Fourth, all ores showed similar phase characteristics, solely sphalerite indicated lower phase magnitude. By fitting the IP spectra on basis of a Cole--Cole model, the parameters chargeability (m) and time constant ({$\tau$}) have been derived. The following relations were confirmed: 1) chargeability rises with increasing ore mineral concentration. 2) The time constant increases with increasing grain radius. Ore-specific quantities are determined by these relations. The results show that conclusions about the ore mineral content, grain radius and fluid conductivity can be derived from laboratory SIP measurements. The method seems to be suitable to identify sulphide minerals in sandy mixtures but a differentiation between the different types of ore minerals remains a challenging task. Nevertheless, more investigations are required to improve the reliability of these findings towards a field scale application.},

The natural operators cannot be combined to construct discrete analogs of the second-order operators div grad, grad div, and curl curl because of incompatibilities in domains and in the ranges of values for the operators. The same is true for the adjoint operators. However, the adjoint operators have complementary domains and ranges of values and the combined set of natural and adjoint operators allow a consistent formulation for all the compound discrete operators.

Dump/ landfill is a major source of contamination of groundwater. This study is therefore designed to review studies on the impact of groundwater contamination due to dumpsites using geophysical and physiochemical methods. The geophysical methods adopted by the studies under review are Electrical Resistivity, Electromagnetic Induction using Very-Low-Frequency and Seismic Refraction methods. The results obtained using the resistivity methods showed zones or area with low resistivity as leachate plume and fractured subsurface as contaminant pathways. The result was complimented by other geophysical techniques applied. The results obtained with the application of physiochemical analyses of leachate inferred various degrees of severe contamination of groundwater due to organics, salts and heavy metals. As such, consumption of such water is dangerous to human health. The review also showed that age of the dumps and the migration distance of the leachate are important factors that require consideration because of the closer the dumpsite the higher the concentration of the contaminant.},

Employing the potentiometric and mass titration techniques in batch experimental methods, the point of zero charge (PZC) and point of zero net proton charge (PZNPC) of MMT edges at different ionic strengths present pHPZC and pHPZNPC to be 3.4 {\textpm} 0.2. A crossing point was observed for the proton adsorption vs. pH curves at different ionic strengths of KCl electrolyte and in investigating MMT remediation potentialities as sorbent for heavy metals polluted waters, the effects of heavy metal concentration, pH, MMT dosage, reaction time and temperature for Cu2+ and Ni2+ uptake were studied. The sorption of metal ions by MMT was pH dependent and the adsorption kinetics revealed sorption rate could be well fitted by the pseudo-second-order rate model. The data according to mass transfer and intraparticle diffusion models confirmed diffusion of solutes inside the clay particles as the rate-controlling step and more important for the adsorption rate than the external mass transfer. Adsorption isotherms showed that the uptake of Cu2+ and Ni2+ could be described by the Langmuir model and from calculations on thermodynamic parameters, the positive G{\textopenbullet} values at different temperatures suggest that the sorption of both metal ions were non-spontaneous. Change in enthalpy ( H{\textopenbullet}) for Ni2+ and Cu2+ were 28.9 and 13.27 kJ/mol K respectively, hence an endothermic diffusion process, as ion uptake increased with increase in temperature. Values of S{\textopenbullet} indicate low randomness at the solid/solution interface during the uptake of both Cu2+ and Ni2+ by MMT. Montmorillonite has a considerable potential for the removal of heavy metal cationic species from aqueous solution and wastewater.},

The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

Bioristor was able to detect changes of ion concentration in the sap upon drought, in particular, those dissolved and transported through the transpiration stream, thus efficiently detecting the occurrence of drought stress immediately after the priming of the defence responses. The bioristor\&\#x2019;s acquired data were coupled with those obtained in a high-throughput phenotyping platform revealing the extreme complementarity of these methods to investigate the mechanisms triggered by the plant during the drought stress event.},

  abstract = {Understanding the intricate relationship between farmers' water usage and its hydrological effects is crucial for developing adaptable water policies. However, conducting such an analysis proves challenging due to the lack of appropriate modeling tools that comprehensively integrate water policies, water utilization, and hydrological processes. To address this challenge, this study introduces an innovative socio-hydrological framework to investigate the interplay between farmer actions and water resources. This framework integrates an agent-based model, which is based on the Value-Belief-Norm (VBN) theory, linked with a distributed hydrological model (SWAT-MODFLOW) to capture farmer behaviors. The modeling framework is applied to the Mahabad River Basin to assess water use and hydrological impacts. To assess the framework's ability, Nash--Sutcliffe (NS) efficiency and the coefficient of determination (R2) are computed for simulating runoff, while Mean Absolute Residual Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) are computed for simulating groundwater head. Results demonstrate the acceptable performance of the proposed model, with NS = 0.61, R2 = 0.69, MAE = 1.16, and RMSE = 1.92. Moreover, this study integrates climate change data from the 6th IPCC report to evaluate the model's responsiveness to altering climate conditions. Findings suggest that farmers facing economic challenges tend to opt for high-profit crops to ameliorate their financial situation. So, without policy changes, climate change will reduce crop yield, farmer income, and water storage. Furthermore, the study evaluates enhancing irrigation efficiency and groundwater extraction restrictions to mitigate climate change effects. Enhancing irrigation efficiency annually conserves 38.39 MCM, boosts crop yields by 6 \%, elevates farmer incomes, and encourages a shift toward low-water-consuming crops, contributing to regional groundwater sustainability. Overall, the results of this study can enhance our comprehension of the impact of human activities on hydrological cycles, offering valuable insights for water managers.},

Near surface soil moisture is pivotal to understand the consequences of these changes. However, the dynamic interactions between vegetation and soil moisture remain largely unresolved because it is difficult to monitor and quantify subsurface hydrologic fluxes at relevant scales. Here we use electrical resistivity to monitor the influence of climate and vegetation on root-zone moisture, bridging the gap between remotely-sensed and in-situ point measurements. Our research quantifies large seasonal differences in root-zone moisture dynamics for a forest--grassland ecotone. We found large differences in effective rooting depth and moisture distributions for the two vegetation types. Our results highlight the likely impacts of land transformations on groundwater recharge, streamflow, and land-atmosphere exchanges.},

Relying on traditional sampling and observation techniques for such insights can be costly, time consuming, and infeasible, especially if the spatial scales involved are large. Geophysical imaging provides an alternative or complement to traditional methods to gather subsurface variables across time and space. In this paper, we review aspects of geophysical imaging, particularly electrical and electromagnetic imaging, that may benefit ecologists seeking clearer understanding of the shallow subsurface. Using electrical resistivity imaging, for example, we have been able to successfully show the effect of land-use conversions to agriculture on salt mobilization and leaching across kilometer-long transects and to depths of tens of meters. Recent advances in ground-penetrating radar and other geophysical imaging methods currently provide opportunities for subsurface imaging with sufficient detail to locate small ({$\geq$}5 cm diameter) animal burrows and plant roots, observe soil-water and vegetation spatial correlations in small watersheds, estuaries, and marshes, and quantify changes in groundwater storage at local to regional scales using geophysical data from ground- and spacebased platforms. Ecologists should benefit from adopting these minimally invasive, scalable imaging technologies to explore the subsurface and advance our collective research.},

Canola seeds and ground canola with moisture contents (m.c. wet basis) of 8.0\%, 10.0\%, 12.0\%, 13.6\% and 14.0\%, soybean with 23.0\% m.c., and wheat with 20.3\% m.c. were used. There were significant differences in CO2 concentrations between 1-d airtight storage time and other airtight storage times except at 40  C. The same moisture content canola at the same environmental condition but in different replicates accumulated different CO2 concentrations at 10  C and 40  C but not at temperatures of 23 and 30  C. Compared with the respiration of microflora, respiration by canola itself was negligible. There was no significant difference in concentration of CO2 produced by microflora within different crops at 35  C, while there was significant difference at 15  C and 25  C. Values of respiration quotients (RQ) were {$>$}1 at almost any testing condition with few exceptions. Sum of CO2 and O2 concentrations were close to 21\%e22\% at most airtight storage times and within any crop. There was a strong positive relationship between the sum and RQ values. The sum might be used to identify whether stored grain had high level of spoiled spots with high moisture content.},

Time-course analyses of ABA content, the production of ROS, and the activities of antioxidant enzymes in water-stressed leaves showed that a signi{\textregistered}cant increase in the content of ABA preceded that of ROS, which was followed by a marked increase in the activities of these antioxidant enzymes. Pretreatment with an ABA biosynthesis inhibitor, tungstate, signi{\textregistered}cantly suppressed the accumulation of ABA, and also reduced the increased generation of ROS and the up-regulation of these antioxidant enzymes in water-stressed leaves. A mild oxidative stress induced by paraquat, which generates O2{\textpm} and then H2O2, resulted in a signi{\textregistered}cant enhancement in the activities of antioxidant enzymes in non-water-stressed leaves. Pretreatment with some ROS scavengers, such as Tiron and dimethylthiourea (DMTU), and an inhibitor of NAD(P)H oxidase, diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), almost completely arrested the increase in ROS and the activities of these antioxidant enzymes induced by water stress or ABA treatment. These data suggest that water stress-induced ABA accumulation triggers the increased generation of ROS, which, in turn, leads to the up-regulation of the antioxidant defence system.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Frozen soil infiltration widely occurs in hydrological processes such as seasonal soil freezing and thawing, snowmelt infiltration, and runoff. Accurate measurement and simulation of parameters related to frozen soil infiltration processes are highly important for agricultural water management, environmental issues, and engineering problems in cold regions. Temperature changes cause soil pore size distribution variations and consequently dynamic infiltration capacity changes during different freeze--thaw periods. To better understand these complex processes and to reveal the freeze--thaw action effects on soil pore distribution and infiltration capacity, black soils, meadow soils, and chernozem were selected as test subjects. These soil types account for the largest arable land area in Heilongjiang Province, China. Laboratory tests of soils at different temperatures were conducted using a tension infiltrometer and ethylene glycol aqueous solution. The stable infiltration rate and hydraulic conductivity were measured, and the soil pore distribution was calculated. The results indicated that for the different soil types, macropores, which constituted approximately 0.1\,\% to 0.2\,\% of the soil volume under unfrozen conditions, contributed approximately 50\,\% of the saturated flow, and after soil freezing, the soil macropore proportion decreased to 0.05\,\% to 0.1\,\%, while the saturated flow proportion decreased to approximately 30\,\%. Soil moisture froze into ice crystals inside relatively large pores, resulting in numerous smaller-sized pores, which reduced the number of macropores but increased the number of smaller-sized mesopores, so that the frozen soil infiltration capacity was no longer solely dependent on the macropores. After the ice crystals had melted, more pores were formed within the soil, enhancing the soil permeability.},

The hard-sphere contribution to the excess Helmholtz energy functional is evaluated using the modified fundamentalmeasure theory and the electrostatic contribution is obtained from the quadratic functional Taylor expansion using the second-order direct correlation function from the mean-spherical approximation. Numerical results for the ionic density profiles and the mean electrostatic potentials near a planar surface of various charge densities are in excellent agreement with molecular simulations. In contrast to the modified Gouy-Chapman theory, the present density functional theory correctly predicts the second layer formation and charge inversion of charged surfaces as observed in simulations and in experiments. The theory has also been tested with the zeta potentials of positively charged polystyrene particles in aqueous solutions of KBr. Good agreement is achieved between the calculated and experimental results.},

From the early measurement of electrical properties by means of normal and lateral resistivity curves, modern logging has progressed through such changes as the introduction of wall-contacting micro-spacing devices, focused devices, dipmeters, and conductive and inductive techniques. Parameters other than electrical have been utilized, such as the radioactive properties of rocks both inherent and as a result of bombardment by both low- and high-energy neutrons; the measurement of acoustic properties; the physical recovery of rock and fluid samples by wire-line; etc. A chronological listing of these developmental steps of formation evaluation by downhole measurement is presented and the earlier ones are discussed in considerable detail. Each relates to a certain phase of development and is the answer to a certain need for evaluation of a specific zone or to overcome limitations of a prior method. It is hoped that this presentation of these tools, measurements, and methods, together with the interpretation techniques associated with them, will honor those who did the work and will inspire future logging engineers and analysts to even greater accomplishments than have preceded them.},

We shall discuss specifically what one can learn from experiments using 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 3rd sound; we also explore the transferability of these results to other transport experiments. Many of the relevant geometrical parameters are those which arise in a canonical electrical conductivity problem in which the porous solid is insulating, the pore fluid is conducting, and there is an additional surface conductivity lining the walls of the pore space. The most important geometrical parameters are the three-dimensional tortuosity of the pore space, a . , the two-dimensional tortuosity of the pore/grain interface, a2, and A, which is a well-defined measure of connected pore sizes.},

  abstract = {Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) has been widely used in environmental applications to study processes associated with subsurface contaminants and contaminant remediation. Anthropogenic alterations in subsurface electrical conductivity associated with contamination often originate from highly industrialized areas with significant amounts of buried metallic infrastructure. The deleterious influence of such infrastructure on imaging results generally limits the utility of ERT where it might otherwise prove useful for subsurface investigation and monitoring. In this manuscript we present a method of accurately modelling the effects of buried conductive infrastructure within the forward modelling algorithm, thereby removing them from the inversion results. The method is implemented in parallel using immersed interface boundary conditions, whereby the global solution is reconstructed from a series of well-conditioned partial solutions. Forward modelling accuracy is demonstrated by comparison with analytic solutions. Synthetic imaging examples are used to investigate imaging capabilities within a subsurface containing electrically conductive buried tanks, transfer piping, and well casing, using both well casings and vertical electrode arrays as current sources and potential measurement electrodes. Results show that, although accurate infrastructure modelling removes the dominating influence of buried metallic features, the presence of metallic infrastructure degrades imaging resolution compared to ERT imaging in the absence of infrastructure. However, it is possible to rectify this degradation in resolution through appropriate placement of electrodes.},

  abstract = {Time-lapse electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) is finding increased application for remotely monitoring processes occurring in the near subsurface in three-dimensions (i.e. 4D monitoring). However, there are few codes capable of simulating the evolution of subsurface resistivity and corresponding tomographic measurements arising from a particular process, particularly in parallel and with an open source license. Herein we describe and demonstrate an electrical resistivity tomography module for the PFLOTRAN subsurface flow and reactive transport simulation code, named PFLOTRAN-E4D. The PFLOTRAN-E4D module operates in parallel using a dedicated set of compute cores in a master-slave configuration. At each time step, the master processes receives subsurface states from PFLOTRAN, converts those states to bulk electrical conductivity, and instructs the slave processes to simulate a tomographic data set. The resulting multi-physics simulation capability enables accurate feasibility studies for ERT imaging, the identification of the ERT signatures that are unique to a given process, and facilitates the joint inversion of ERT data with hydrogeological data for subsurface characterization. PFLOTRAN-E4D is demonstrated herein using a field study of stage-driven groundwater/river water interaction ERT monitoring along the Columbia River, Washington, USA. Results demonstrate the complex nature of subsurface electrical conductivity changes, in both the saturated and unsaturated zones, arising from river stage fluctuations and associated river water intrusion into the aquifer. The results also demonstrate the sensitivity of surface based ERT measurements to those changes over time. PFLOTRAN-E4D is available with the PFLOTRAN development version with an open-source license at https://bitbucket.org/pflotran/pflotrandev.},

These techniques allow the study of the spatial and temporal variations of geological structures. This paper aims at presenting a current state-of-the-art on the application of surface geophysical methods to landslide characterization and focuses on recent papers (after 1990) published in peer-reviewed International Journals. Until recently, geophysical techniques have been relatively little used for the reconnaissance of landslides for at least two main reasons. The first one is that geophysical methods provide images in terms of physical parameters which are not directly linked to the geological and mechanical properties required by geologists and engineers. The second reason shown through this study probably comes from a tendency among a part of the geophysicists to overestimate the quality and reliability of the results. This paper gave the opportunity to review recent applications of the main geophysical techniques to landslide characterisation, showing both their interest and their limits. We also emphasized the geophysical image characteristics (resolution, penetration depth) which have to be provided for assessing their reliability, as well as the absolute requirements to combine geophysical methods and to calibrate them with existing geological and geotechnical data. We hope that this paper will contribute to fill the gaps between communities and to strength of using appropriate geophysical methods for landslide investigation.},

  abstract = {This paper presents time stability analyses of soil moisture at different spatial measurement support scales (point scale and airborne remote sensing (RS) footprint scale 800 m {\texttimes} 800 m) in two different hydroclimatic regions. The data used in the analyses consist of in situ and passive microwave remotely sensed soil moisture data from the Southern Great Plains Hydrology Experiments 1997 and 1999 (SGP97 and SGP99) conducted in the Little Washita (LW) watershed, Oklahoma, and the Soil Moisture Experiments 2002 and 2005 (SMEX02 and SMEX05) in the Walnut Creek (WC) watershed, Iowa. Results show that in both the regions soil properties (i.e., percent silt, percent sand, and soil texture) and topography (elevation and slope) are significant physical controls jointly affecting the spatiotemporal evolution and time stability of soil moisture at both point and footprint scales. In Iowa, using point-scale soil moisture measurements, the WC11 field was found to be more time stable (TS) than the WC12 field. The common TS points using data across the 3 year period (2002--2005) were mostly located at moderate to high elevations in both the fields. Furthermore, the soil texture at these locations consists of either loam or clay loam soil. Drainage features and cropping practices also affected the field-scale soil moisture variability in the WC fields. In Oklahoma, the field having a flat topography (LW21) showed the worst TS features compared to the fields having gently rolling topography (LW03 and LW13). The LW13 field (silt loam) exhibited better time stability than the LW03 field (sandy loam) and the LW21 field (silt loam). At the RS footprint scale, in Iowa, the analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests show that the percent clay and percent sand are better able to discern the TS features of the footprints compared to the soil texture. The best soil indicator of soil moisture time stability is the loam soil texture. Furthermore, the hilltops (slope {$\sim$}0\%--0.45\%) exhibited the best TS characteristics in Iowa. On the other hand, in Oklahoma, ANOVA results show that the footprints with sandy loam and loam soil texture are better indicators of the time stability phenomena. In terms of the hillslope position, footprints with mild slope (0.93\%--1.85\%) are the best indicators of TS footprints. Also, at both point and footprint scales in both the regions, land use--land cover type does not influence soil moisture time stability.},

Surface wettability alteration by nanomaterial fabrication and coating is of recent interest among researchers to attain desirable wetting surfaces. The wettability of liquid over a surface changes with surface properties such as roughness, surface energy, porosity, capillarity, and structure. Eventually, surface chemistry plays major role in changing surface energy which in turn leads to wettability alteration toward wetting and non-wetting extents. Herein, the dependence of surface properties in wettability alteration has been analyzed with the literature reports. Furthermore, surface pre- and post-treatments such as laser, ozone plasma, and UV irradiation contribute to change of surface energy inducing the liquid to encroach toward superhydrophilicity and superhydrophobicity. This review article analyzes the properties that induces wetting and non-wetting ability of liquids over surfaces. Theoretical models opted for wettability determination has been accounted to study the contribution of roughness, porosity, and surface energy. The article provides a clear idea of properties involved in wettability alteration with respect to wide range of applications in energy conversion, oil--water separation, self-cleaning, bio-adhesion, and bio-molecular immobilization.},

  abstract = {We have developed a mechanistic model to interpret spectral induced polarization data of partially saturated clay-rocks. This model accounts for the polarization of the grains through an electrical double layer model with a polarization model of the inner part of the electrical double layer called the Stern layer. The polarization model accounts also for the Maxwell--Wagner polarization at frequencies higher than 100 Hz. The Maxwell--Wagner polarization is modelled by using a conductivity model modified to account for the presence of a non-wetting immiscible phase like air in the pore space. The resulting model is consistent with the first and second Archie's laws in the case where surface conductivity can be neglected. The volumetric charge density of the diffuse layer at saturation is divided by the saturation of the water phase to account for the partial water saturation of the porous material. The model comprises seven fundamental parameters: the formation factor, the second Archie's exponent, a critical water saturation level, the mean electrical potential of the pore space at saturation, the density of the counterions in the Stern layer, and at least two parameters describing the grain size distribution. Most of these parameters can be derived independently using alternative measurements and electrochemical models. Measurements were performed in the frequency range 10 mHz--45 kHz using five samples from the Callovo--Oxfordian formation in the eastern part of the Paris Basin, France. The model agrees fairly well with the experimental data at saturation and for partially saturated clay-rocks down to 1 Hz. Most of the seven physical parameters entering the model were independently evaluated.},

  abstract = {Japanese plum (Prunus salicina) farming in the Western Cape (South Africa) is an important industry for the export market and job creation and is a large water user; however, adequate information on water requirements of this crop is not available in this semi-arid area. The objective of this study was to determine seasonal plum water requirements for the purpose of water use planning and allocation. The study made use of experimental data from four fully bearing, high-yielding plum orchards (cv African Delight and Fortune) in two major plum production regions (Robertson and Wellington). Crop water requirements and the soil water balance were modelled with the physically based HYDRUS-2D model. Seasonal crop water requirements were estimated to be between 524 mm (cv Fortune in Wellington) and 864 mm (cv African Delight in Robertson). Initial basal crop coefficients (Kcb) ranged between 0.98 and 1.01, whilst Kcb for the mid-stage averaged between 1.11 (cv African Delight in Robertson) and 1.18 (cv Fortune in Wellington). Modelling scenarios indicated that soil water redistribution beyond the root zone continues at reduced rates after the soil dries to levels below field capacity. Irrigation management needs to be balanced with other farming practices to reduce leaching and impacts on water resource quality, as well as with the economics of the farm.},

With an increasing electrolyte concentration, the shape of differential capacitance curve changes from that with a minimum surrounded by maxima into that of a distorted single maximum. For a 2:1 electrolyte, the maximum is located at a small negative {$\sigma$} value while for 1:2, at a small positive value.},

  abstract = {Urban climate experimental results from the Comprehensive Outdoor Scale Model (COSMO) were used to estimate roughness lengths for momentum and heat. Two different physical scale models were used to investigate the scale dependence of the roughness lengths; the large scale model included an aligned array of 1.5-m concrete cubes, and the small scale model had a geometrically similar array of 0.15-m concrete cubes. Only turbulent data from the unstable boundary layers were considered. The roughness length for momentum relative to the obstacle height was dependent on wind direction, but the scale dependence was not evident. Estimated values agreed well with a conventional morphometric relationship. The logarithm of the roughness length for heat relative to the obstacle height depended on the scale but was insensitive to wind direction. COSMO data were used successfully to regress a theoretical relationship between ␬BϪ1, the logarithmic ratio of roughness length for momentum to heat, and Re*, the roughness Reynolds number. Values of ␬BϪ1 associated with Re* for three different urban sites from previous field experiments were intercompared. A surprising finding was that, even though surface geometry differed from site to site, the regressed function agreed with data from the three urban sites as well as with the COSMO data. Field data showed that ␬BϪ1 values decreased as the areal fraction of vegetation increased. The observed dependency of the bulk transfer coefficient on atmospheric stability in the COSMO data could be reproduced using the regressed function of Re* and ␬BϪ1, together with a Monin--Obukhov similarity framework.},

  abstract = {Electromagnetic (EM) methods are used to characterize the electrical conductivity distribution of the earth. EM geophysical surveys are increasingly being simulated and inverted in 3D, due in part to computational advances. However, the availability of computational resources does not invalidate the use of lower dimensional formulations and methods, which can be useful depending on the geological complexity as well as the survey geometry. Due to their computational speed, simulations in 1D or 2D can also be used to quickly gain geologic insight. For example, this insight can be used in an EM inversion starting with a 1D inversion, then building higher dimensionality into the model progressively. As such, we require a set of tools that allow a geophysicists to easily explore various model dimensionalities, such as 1D, 2D, and 3D, in the EM inversion. In this study, we suggest a mapping methodology that transforms the inversion model to a physical property for use in the forward simulations. Using this general methodology, we apply an EM inversion to a suite of models in one, two, and three dimensions, and suggest the importance of choosing an appropriate model space based on the goal of the EM inversion.},

  abstract = {When performing Spectral Induced Polarization (SIP) laboratory measurements undesirable polarization effects have to be avoided. Those effects usually arise when the sample holder is badly designed. Especially, position, shape and type of potential electrodes play a major role in the measurements. Prior to any use, the sample holder must be characterized (1) to determine the geometrical factor, and (2) to assess transfer function of the measuring system. Both can be assessed by carrying measurements on sample holder filled with electrolyte of different conductivities. We present here an inappropriately designed sample holder, which consists in a 20 cm-long, 7.4 cm-diameter PVC tube. Current electrodes are stainless steel plates and potential electrodes are two collar clamps fixed inside the tube. Measurements were performed between 5 mHz and 20 kHz. All SIP measurements using KCl electrolytes of different conductivities showed a clear phase peak at about 1 Hz. This peak cannot be caused by the solution, since there is no relaxation mechanism at very low frequency in the water; therefore it is due to the experimental design. The frequency at which the phase peak is maximum shows an inverse relationship with the electrolyte resistivity while the maximum phase amplitude is independent of the resistivity. We develop an analytical function that closely models the measured responses. A procedure of correction based on that model was however not enough to remove the parasitic polarization effects as shown for measurements with silica sand. Using COMSOL Multiphysics, we validate the geometrical factor and we assessed the effect of the surface capacitance of the electrodes. The phase peak observed experimentally can be reproduced. We find also that the surface impedance influences the geometrical factor.},

  abstract = {The sequence of two infiltration steps combined with an intermediate aeration named `sequential managed aquifer recharge technology (SMART)' proved to be a promising approach to replenish groundwater using treated wastewater effluents or impaired surface waters due to efficient inactivation of pathogens and improved removal of many trace organic chemicals. To minimize the physical footprint of such systems and overcome limitations through site-specific heterogeneity at conventional MAR sites, an engineered approach was taken to further advance the SMART concept. This study investigated the establishment of plug-flow conditions in a pilot scale subsurface bioreactor by providing highly controlled hydraulic conditions. Such a system, with a substantially reduced physical footprint in comparison to conventional MAR systems, could be applied independent of local hydrogeological conditions. The desired redox conditions in the bioreactor are achieved by in-situ oxygen delivery, to maintain the homogenous flow conditions and eliminate typical pumping costs. For the time being, this study investigated hydraulic conditions and the initial performance regarding the removal of chemical constituents during baseline operation of the SMARTplus bioreactor. The fit of the observed and simulated breakthrough curves from the pulse injection tracer test indicated successful establishment of plug-flow conditions throughout the bioreactor. The performance data obtained during baseline operation confirmed similar trace organic chemical biotransformation as previously observed in lab- and field-scale MAR systems during travel times of b13 h. {\copyright} 2020 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {High resolution data on plant available potassium (Ka) is crucial to optimize variable rate potassium fertilizer recommendations, and subsequently improve crop growth and yield. A gamma-ray passive spectrometry sensor was evaluated for on-the-go mapping and management of the spatial distribution of Ka over a 8.4 ha field at Huldenberg, Belgium. During the on-the-go measurement, a 5 s sampling interval was used while driving at 3 km/h speed along 10 m parallel transects. Two calibration models to predict Ka across the field were developed and compared: (1) a simple third order polynomial function (3DPF) was established between the sensor reading of the naturally occurring radioactive isotope of potassium (K-40) and laboratory measured Ka and (2) a partial least squares regression (PLSR) model linking gamma-ray spectra and laboratory measured Ka. Although a relatively small number of samples (45 samples) were used for the development of the PLSR calibration model, the cross-validation analysis resulted in a very good performance with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.85, a residual prediction deviation (RPD) of 2.67, a root mean square error of cross-validation (RMSECV) of 2.29 (mg/100 g) and a ratio of performance to interquartile distance (RPIQ) of 2.61. This was a much better result that that obtained with the 3DPF model (R2 = 0.69). The spatial distribution of Ka developed based on 3DPF and PLSR methods showed great similarity with the corresponding map developed using the data from the laboratory analysis. The calculated variable rate fertilizer recommendation based on gamma-ray data showed marginal differences in the amount of K2O fertilizer applied, compared to the uniform rate fertilization based on the conventional laboratory chemical soil analyses. The on-the-go measurement of Ka using gamma-ray spectrometry shows high potential, although the technology needs to be evaluated in a larger number of fields.},

  abstract = {Biogeochemical hotspots are defined as areas where biogeochemical processes occur with anomalously high reaction rates relative to their surroundings. Due to their importance in carbon and nutrient cycling, the characterization of hotspots is critical for predicting carbon budgets accurately in the context of climate change. However, biogeochemical hotspots are difficult to identify in the environment, as methods for in situ measurements often directly affect the sensitive redox-chemical conditions. Here, we present imaging results of a geophysical survey using the non-invasive induced polarization (IP) method to identify biogeochemical hotspots of carbon turnover in a minerotrophic wetland. To interpret the field-scale IP signatures, geochemical analyses were performed on freeze-core samples obtained in areas characterized by anomalously high and low IP responses. Our results reveal large variations in the electrical response, with the highest IP phase values ({$>$} 18 mrad) corresponding to high concentrations of phosphates ({$>$} 4000 {\textmu}M), an indicator of carbon turnover. Furthermore, we found a strong relationship between the electrical properties resolved in IP images and the dissolved organic carbon. Moreover, analysis of the freeze core reveals negligible concentrations of iron sulfides. The extensive geochemical and geophysical data presented in our study demonstrate that IP images can track small-scale changes in the biogeochemical activity in peat and can be used to identify hotspots.},

  abstract = {Measurements of the effective complex electrical conductivity in the mHz to kHz frequency range using Spectral Induced Polarization (SIP) have shown promise for the characterization of soil physical and biogeochemical properties and processes. In principle, the spatial distribution of the complex electrical conductivity can be determined using Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT). However, little is known about the accuracy of EIT imaging results, which is known to be affected by the need for a consistent treatment of variable data quality for different frequencies in the inversion process. Therefore, we aim to evaluate the ability of EIT to accurately determine the distribution of spectral electrical conductivity in the mHz to kHz frequency range. For this, we used artificially packed lysimeter columns with known structure and spectral electrical properties. EIT imaging of these columns was performed during drainage in order to investigate data quality and the accuracy of soil spectral electrical property determination for different saturation and contact impedances of the electrodes. Spectral imaging results were analyzed using a Debye-decomposition approach and compared with effective SIP measurements on independent samples of the same material. Overall, there was a good correspondence between imaged and independently measured complex electrical conductivity. Furthermore, it was found that images of peak relaxation time distribution were much less affected by spatial smoothing than images of the normalized chargeability. It was concluded that state-of-the-art data processing and inversion procedures in combination with advanced EIT equipment can be used to accurately image the spatial distribution of spectral electrical properties.},

  abstract = {Complex resistivity may provide valuable information about the structural and hydraulic nature of porous media and fluids contained within such media. The environmental value of such a property is obvious. To date most environmental applications of complex resistivity have focussed on relatively crude data analysis methods and restrictive electrode configurations. New tomographic methods are becoming available that will allow complex resistivity to be employed with arbitrary electrode arrangements. Laboratory trials of our extensions of electrical resistivity tomography to a complex form are reported. The inversion procedure is presented and demonstrated for a range of targets, with resistive and reactive characteristics. The approach is shown to provide useful magnitude and phase images, giving spectral information about the region of interest. Cole--Cole analysis of the inversion results reveals specific material relaxation characteristics. The usefulness of imaging complex resistivity is evident when compared with more conventional resistivity tomography, in particular when examined over a range of input frequencies. {\copyright}2000 Elsevier Science S.A.

It emphasizes recent advances in the understanding of the induced polarization signals stemming from biological materials and their activity, points out new developments and applications, and identifies existing knowledge gaps. The focus of this review is on the application of induced polarization to study living organisms: soil microorganisms and plants (both roots and stems). We first discuss observed links between the induced polarization signal and microbial cell structure, activity and biofilm formation. We provide an up-to-date conceptual model of the electrical behaviour of the microbial cells and biofilms under the influence of an external electrical field. We also review the latest biogeophysical studies, including work on hydrocarbon biodegradation, contaminant sequestration, soil strengthening and peatland characterization. We then elaborate on the induced polarization signature of the plant-root zone, relying on a conceptual model for the generation of biogeophysical signals from a plant-root cell. First laboratory experiments show that single roots and root system are highly polarizable. They also present encouraging results for imaging root systems embedded in a medium, and gaining information on the mass density distribution, the structure or the physiological characteristics of root systems. In addition, we highlight the application of induced polarization to characterize wood and tree structures through tomography of the stem. Finally, we discuss up- and down-scaling between laboratory and field studies, as well as joint interpretation of induced polarization and other environmental data. We emphasize the need for intermediate-scale studies and the benefits of using induced polarization as a time-lapse monitoring method. We conclude with the promising integration of induced polarization in interdisciplinary mechanistic models to better understand and quantify subsurface biogeochemical processes.},

  abstract = {Abstract. The rewetting of dry soils and the thawing of frozen soils are short-term, transitional phenomena in terms of hydrology and the thermodynamics of soil systems. The impact of these short-term phenomena on larger scale ecosystem fluxes is increasingly recognized, and a growing number of studies show that these events affect fluxes of soil gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), ammonia (NH3) and nitric oxide (NO). Global climate models predict that future climatic change is likely to alter the frequency and intensity of drying-rewetting events and thawing of frozen soils. These future scenarios highlight the importance of understanding how rewetting and thawing will influence dynamics of these soil gases. This study summarizes findings using a new database containing 338 studies conducted from 1956 to 2011, and highlights open research questions. The database revealed conflicting results following rewetting and thawing in various terrestrial ecosystems and among soil gases, ranging from large increases in fluxes to non-significant changes. Studies reporting lower gas fluxes before rewetting tended to find higher post-rewetting fluxes for CO2, N2O and NO; in addition, increases in N2O flux following thawing were greater in warmer climate regions. We discuss possible mechanisms and controls that regulate flux responses, and recommend that a high temporal resolution of flux measurements is critical to capture rapid changes in gas fluxes after these soil perturbations. Finally, we propose that future studies should investigate the interactions between biological (i.e., microbial community and gas production) and physical (i.e., porosity, diffusivity, dissolution) changes in soil gas fluxes, apply techniques to capture rapid changes (i.e., automated measurements), and explore synergistic experimental and modelling approaches.},

Highthroughput pyrosequencing technology was used to assess the shift in microbial community of leachate from animal carcass lysimeter. The leachate samples were collected monthly for one year and a total of 164,639 pyrosequencing reads were obtained and used in the taxonomic classification and operational taxonomy units (OTUs) distribution analysis based on sequence similarity. Our results show considerable changes in the phylum-level bacterial composition, suggesting that the microbial community is a sensitive parameter affected by the burial environment. The phylum classification results showed that Proteobacteria (Pseudomonas) were the most influential taxa in earlier decomposition stage whereas Firmicutes (Clostridium, Sporanaerobacter, and Peptostreptococcus) were dominant in later stage under anaerobic conditions. The result of this study can provide useful information on a time series of leachate profiles of microbial community structures and suggest patterns of microbial diversity in livestock burial sites. In addition, this result can be applicable to predict the decomposition stages under clay loam based soil conditions of animal livestock.},

Using atomistic simulations, we show that dolomite initially precipitates a cation-disordered surface, where high surface strains inhibit further crystal growth. However, mild undersaturation will preferentially dissolve these disordered regions, enabling increased order upon reprecipitation. Our simulations predict that frequent cycling of a solution between supersaturation and undersaturation can accelerate dolomite growth by up to seven orders of magnitude. We validated our theory with in situ liquid cell transmission electron microscopy, directly observing bulk dolomite growth after pulses of dissolution. This mechanism explains why modern dolomite is primarily found in natural environments with pH or salinity fluctuations. More generally, it reveals that the growth and ripening of defect-free crystals can be facilitated by deliberate periods of mild dissolution.                        ,              Editor's summary                            Dolomite, a calcium magnesium carbonate, is one of the major minerals in carbonate rocks. However, growing the mineral under laboratory conditions has proven very difficult, resulting in the so-called ``dolomite problem.'' Kim               et al               . may have solved this problem by identifying the need to cycle the solution between undersaturated and supersaturated conditions (see the Perspective by Garc{\'i}a-Ruiz). Cycling speeds up crystal growth 10 million times and may be imperative for making large amounts of dolomite. This observation is consistent with where we see dolomite formation in nature: in coastal and evaporative environments. ---Brent Grocholski                        ,              Dolomite, a calcium magnesium carbonate, requires cycling of saturation conditions to grow.},

  abstract = {Ions transported through plasma membranes encounter electrical charges, and associated electrical potentials, at the membrane surfaces. The ionic composition of the tissue-bathing medium influences both the surface charge density and the surface electrical potential. Changes in surface electrical potential may affect ion transport by altering two components of the chemical potential difference ({$\Delta$}{\textmu}j ) of an ion through the membrane. First, the surface activity of the transported ion will change because of electrostatic attraction or repulsion. Second, the surface-to-surface transmembrane potential difference will change. (This is different from the bulk-phase-to-bulk-phase transmembrane potential difference measured with microelectrodes.) These changes in the components of the chemical potential may change the flux of an ion through the membrane even if the surface-to-surface {$\Delta$}{\textmu}j (equal to the bulk-phase-to-bulk-phase {$\Delta$}{\textmu}j ) remains constant. The Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) flux equation does not take into account these surface-potential effects. The equation has been modified to incorporate surface potentials computed by a Gouy-Chapman-Stern model and surface ion activities computed by Nernst equations. The modified equation (despite several additional deficiencies of the GHK model) successfully predicts many transport phenomena not predicted by the standard GHK equation. Thus electrostatic effects may account for saturation, cis- and trans-inhibition, rectification, voltage gating, shifts in voltage optima, and other phenomena also attributable to other mechanisms.},

How they do this shapes floods, droughts, biogeochemical cycles, contaminant transport, and the health of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Because many of the key processes occur invisibly in the subsurface, our conceptualization of them has often relied heavily on physical intuition. In recent decades, however, much of this intuition has been overthrown by field observations and emerging measurement methods, particularly involving isotopic tracers. Here we summarize key surprises that have transformed our understanding of hydrological processes at the scale of hillslopes and drainage basins. These surprises have forced a shift in perspective from process conceptualizations that are relatively static, homogeneous, linear, and stationary to ones that are predominantly dynamic, heterogeneous, nonlinear, and nonstationary.},

  abstract = {The shallow Murtal aquifer south of Graz, Austria, provides easily withdrawable groundwater, which is supplied as drinking water without any chemical treatment. The aquifer is also used intensively by agriculture. Common agricultural management practices are the main source for diffuse nitrogen leaching and high groundwater nitrate concentrations. To safeguard the coexisting use of these two important resources, lysimeters are operated at the agricultural test site Wagna, Austria, and the influence of two beneficial management practices -- low nitrogen input and organic farming -- on nitrogen leaching towards groundwater is investigated. The technical lysimeter design as presented here consists of: (1) high-resolution weighing cells, (2) a suction controlled lower boundary condition for sucking off seepage water, thus emulating undisturbed field conditions, (3) comparative soil temperature, water content and matrix potential measurements inside and outside the lysimeter at different depths, (4) an installation of the lysimeters directly into test plots and (5) a removable upper lysimeter ring enabling machinery soil tillage. Our results indicate that oasis effects or fringe effects of the lysimeter cylinder on unsaturated water flow did not occur. Another lysimeter cultivated with lawn is operated for observing grass-reference evapotranspiration, which resulted in good agreement with calculated grassreference evapotranspiration according to the FAO-Penman--Monteith method. We conclude that lysimeters installed at Wagna test site did not show any fringe effects and, thus, are appropriate tools for measuring water balance elements and nitrogen leaching of arable and grass land at point scale. Furthermore, our results for the period of 2005 to 2011 show that beneficial management practices reduced nitrate leaching and, hence, may allow for a sustainable coexistence of drinking water supply and agriculture in the Murtal aquifer.},

  abstract = {Frequency-domain electromagnetic (FDEM) data are commonly inverted to characterize subsurface geoelectrical properties using smoothness constraints in 1D inversion schemes assuming a layered medium. Smoothness constraints are suitable for imaging gradual transitions of subsurface geoelectrical properties caused, for example, by varying sand, clay, or fluid content. However, such inversion approaches are limited in charac\- terizing sharp interfaces. Alternative regularizations based on the minimum gradient support (MGS) stabilizers can, instead, be used to promote results with different levels of smoothness/sharpness selected by simply acting on the so-called focusing parameter. The MGS regularization has been implemented for different kinds of geophysical data inversion strategies. However, concerning FDEM data, the MGS regularization has only been implemented for vertically constrained inversion (VCI) approaches but not for laterally constrained inversion (LCI) approaches.},

  abstract = {Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) logging provides a new means of estimating the hydraulic conductivity (K ) of unconsolidated aquifers. The estimation of K from the measured NMR parameters can be performed using the Schlumberger-Doll Research (SDR) equation, which is based on the Kozeny--Carman equation and initially developed for obtaining permeability from NMR logging in petroleum reservoirs. The SDR equation includes empirically determined constants. Decades of research for petroleum applications have resulted in standard values for these constants that can provide accurate estimates of permeability in consolidated formations. The question we asked: Can standard values for the constants be defined for hydrogeologic applications that would yield accurate estimates of K in unconsolidated aquifers? Working at 10 locations at three field sites in Kansas and Washington, USA, we acquired NMR and K data using direct-push methods over a 10- to 20-m depth interval in the shallow subsurface. Analysis of pairs of NMR and K data revealed that we could dramatically improve K estimates by replacing the standard petroleum constants with new constants, optimal for estimating K in the unconsolidated materials at the field sites. Most significant was the finding that there was little change in the SDR constants between sites. This suggests that we can define a new set of constants that can be used to obtain high resolution, cost-effective estimates of K from NMR logging in unconsolidated aquifers. This significant result has the potential to change dramatically the approach to determining K for hydrogeologic applications.},

The second example shows macropores created by roots and soil microorganisms in a Haplic Luvisol and subsequently affected by clay coatings.

  abstract = {Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) has proved to be a valuable tool for imaging solute transport processes in the subsurface. However, a quantitative interpretation of corresponding ERT results is constrained by a number of factors. One such factor is the nonuniqueness of the ERT inverse problem if no additional constraints are imposed. In the vadose zone, further problems arise from the general ambiguity of the imaged bulk electrical conductivity in terms of water content and solute concentration. In this study we address these issues in detail for a solute tracer experiment conducted in an undisturbed unsaturated soil monolith where the tracer transport was monitored by means of 3-D smoothness-constrained ERT and time domain reflectometry (TDR) measurements. The experimental design allowed the determination of solute tracer concentrations directly from imaged bulk electrical conductivity. Independent TDR data and effluent tracer concentrations provided a ``ground truth'' for the ERT-derived apparent convection-dispersion equation transport parameters. The apparent transport velocity calculated from the ERT results was consistent with that based on TDR data and the sampled effluent, independent of the degree of smoothness imposed in the ERT inversion. On the other hand, the apparent dispersivity calculated from the ERT results was larger than that estimated from TDR data but smaller than that estimated from the sampled effluent, with the magnitude of deviations dependent on the degree of smoothing. Importantly, no mass balance problems were observed in the ERT results. We believe that this is largely a consequence of the uniform application of the tracer as a front and of the configuration of the electrode array with respect to the main transport direction. In conclusion, the study demonstrates that ERT can yield unprecedented quantitative information about local- and column-scale solute transport characteristics in natural soils.},

In spite of their hydrological relevance for the maintenance of precious natural wetland and wildlife environments and a range of other ecosystem services, only limited knowledge of soil water dynamics in dune belts is currently available. This study presents soil water balance components measured during one hydrological year using a high precision meteo-lysimeter with lower boundary control installed in a coastal dune belt under a dry subhumid climate in southern Spain close to the Atlantic Ocean. The site is equipped with a cylindrical lysimeter of 1 m2 surface and 1.50 m height (METER Group, Inc. USA) and a weighing resolution of 10 g, 2 SC650 soil moisture sensors (Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT) and 1 automatic meteorological station. The lower boundary condition at the bottom of the lysimeter is controlled at 1.4 m depth by a bidirectional peristaltic pump to maintain field conditions. Results show a recharge rate of 64\% of the precipitation measured by the lysimeter. Diurnal oscillations of the measured upper boundary flow during days without rainfall represented vapor adsorption and real evaporation rates ranging between 0.3 and 0.4 mm/day and 0.4 and 0.6 mm/day, respectively throughout the whole year summing up an annual vapor adsorption of 77 mm. The measured precipitation of the lysimeter exceeded pluviometer data by 13\% as a result of vapor adsorption. The presented results provide a precise balance of soil water components in a coastal dune belt including the relevant contribution of vapor flow.},

Meteorological data were measured on-site at 10-min intervals, including temperature, relative humidity, wind velocity and net radiation. After manual and automatic noise elimination of the lysimeter data, time series of a summer and winter period were generated for selected relevant parameters. Furthermore, daily cumulative data of inward and outward vapor flux were calculated for the entire period and analyzed for their control by meteorological parameters and soil moisture. Results show moderate correlations of daily outward vapor flux on the diurnal amplitudes of temperature and humidity whereas daily inward vapor indicates moderate correlations with temperature and soil moisture. A correction coefficient for potential evaporation to estimate actual evaporation was determined based on soil moisture and air temperature.},

  abstract = {Cosmic-ray neutron probes are widely used to monitor environmental water content near the surface. The method averages over tens of hectares and is unrivaled in serving representative data for agriculture and hydrological models at the hectometer scale. Recent experiments, however, indicate that the sensor response to environmental heterogeneity is not fully understood. Knowledge of the support volume is a prerequisite for the proper interpretation and validation of hydrogeophysical data. In a previous study, several physical simplifications have been introduced into a neutron transport model in order to derive the characteristics of the cosmic-ray probe's footprint. We utilize a refined source and energy spectrum for cosmic-ray neutrons and simulate their response to a variety of environmental conditions. Results indicate that the method is particularly sensitive to soil moisture in the first tens of meters around the probe, whereas the radial weights are changing dynamically with ambient water. The footprint radius ranges from 130 to 240 m depending on air humidity, soil moisture, and vegetation. The moisture-dependent penetration depth of 15 to 83 cm decreases exponentially with distance to the sensor. However, the footprint circle remains almost isotropic in complex terrain with nearby rivers, roads or hill slopes. Our findings suggest that a dynamically weighted average of point measurements is essential for accurate calibration and validation. The new insights will have important impact on signal interpretation, sensor installation, data interpolation from mobile surveys, and the choice of appropriate resolutions for data assimilation into hydrological models.},

  abstract = {Investigations of neutron transport through air and soil by Monte Carlo simulations led to major advancements toward a precise interpretation of measurements; they particularly improved the understanding of the cosmic-ray neutron footprint. Up to now, the conversion of soil moisture to a detectable neutron count rate has relied mainly on the equation presented by Desilets and Zreda in 2010. While in general a hyperbolic expression can be derived from theoretical considerations, their empiric parameterization needs to be revised for two reasons. Firstly, a rigorous mathematical treatment reveals that the values of the four parameters are ambiguous because their values are not independent. We found a three-parameter equation with unambiguous values of the parameters that is equivalent in any other respect to the four-parameter equation. Secondly, high-resolution Monte-Carlo simulations revealed a systematic deviation of the count rate to soil moisture relation especially for extremely dry conditions as well as very humid conditions. That is a hint that a smaller contribution to the intensity was forgotten or not adequately treated by the conventional approach. Investigating the above-ground neutron flux through a broadly based Monte-Carlo simulation campaign revealed a more detailed understanding of different contributions to this signal, especially targeting air humidity corrections. The packages MCNP and URANOS were used to derive a function able to describe the respective dependencies, including the effect of different hydrogen pools and the detector-specific response function. The new relationship has been tested at two exemplary measurement sites, and its remarkable performance allows for a promising prospect of more comprehensive data quality in the future.},

  abstract = {Series of experiments were performed to study the spectral induced polarization (SIP) response of sands fully saturated with water, into which gaseous CO2 or N2 was injected, in the frequency range 0.5 Hz--20 kHz. Three main observations were made. (1) SIP parameters were always most affected by gas injection when the frequency of the injected signal was in the intermediate range (1 {$<$} f {$<$} 20 kHz). This point emphasizes the interest of broadening the frequency range of SIP surveys toward intermediate frequencies. It also implies that more work is needed in order to understand and quantify the parasitic effects that occur at this frequency range (EM coupling and electrode polarization). (2) Through all the experiments performed, we were able to distinguish the parameters variations caused by a reduction of the water saturation level (invasion of a resistive gas phase in the porous space) from those resulting from dissolution processes (increase of the electrical conductivity of the saturating water). (3) The quadrature conductivity {$\sigma$} , which is mainly linked to the capacitive properties and inductive response of the media, always shows relative variations stronger than the resistivity of the media, hence demonstrating the interest of the additional information provided by the SIP method as against the classical resistivity method.},

  abstract = {A quantitative understanding of actual evapotranspiration (ETa) and soil--water dynamics in a hillslope agroecosystem is vital for sustainable water resource management and soil conservation; however, the complexity of processes and conditions involving lateral subsurface flow (LSF) can be a limiting factor in the full comprehension of hillslope soil--water dynamics. The research was carried out at SUPREHILL CZO located on a hillslope agroecosystem (vineyard) over a period of two years (2021--2022) by combining soil characterization and field hydrological measurements, including weighing lysimeters, sensor measurements, and LSF collection system measurements. Lysimeters were placed on the hilltop and the footslope, both having a dynamic controlled bottom boundary, which corresponded to field pressure head measurements, to mimic field soil--water dynamics. Water balance components between the two positions on the slope were compared with the goal of identifying differences that might reveal hydrologically driven differences due to LSF paths across the hillslope. The usually considered limitations of these lysimeters, or the borders preventing LSF through the domain, acted as an aid within this installation setup, as the lack of LSF was compensated for through the pumping system at the footslope. The findings from lysimeters were compared with LSF collection system measurements. Weighing lysimeter data indicated that LSF controlled ETa rates. The results suggest that the onset of LSF contributes to the spatial crop productivity distribution in hillslopes. The present approach may be useful for investigating the impact of LSF on water balance components for similar hillslope sites and crops or other soil surface covers.},

  abstract = {The root system plays an essential role in the development and physiology of the plant, as well as in its response to various stresses. However, it is often insufficiently studied, mainly because it is difficult to visualize. For grapevine, a plant of major economic interest, there is a growing need to study the root system, in particular to assess its resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses, understand the decline that may affect it, and identify new ecofriendly production systems. In this context, we have evaluated and compared three distinct growing methods (hydroponics, plane, and cylindric rhizotrons) in order to describe relevant architectural root traits of grapevine cuttings (mode of grapevine propagation), and also two 2D- (hydroponics and rhizotron) and one 3D- (neutron tomography) imaging techniques for visualization and quantification of roots. We observed that hydroponics tubes are a system easy to implement but do not allow the direct quantification of root traits over time, conversely to 2D imaging in rhizotron. We demonstrated that neutron tomography is relevant to quantify the root volume. We have also produced a new automated analysis method of digital photographs, adapted for identifying adventitious roots as a feature of root architecture in rhizotrons. This method integrates image segmentation, skeletonization, detection of adventitious root skeleton, and adventitious root reconstruction. Although this study was targeted to grapevine, most of the results obtained could be extended to other plants propagated by cuttings. Image analysis methods could also be adapted to characterization of the root system from seedlings.},

  abstract = {While fulfilling the food demand of an increasing population remains a major global concern, more than one-third of food is lost or wasted in postharvest operations. Reducing the postharvest losses, especially in developing countries, could be a sustainable solution to increase food availability, reduce pressure on natural resources, eliminate hunger and improve farmers' livelihoods. Cereal grains are the basis of staple food in most of the developing nations, and account for the maximum postharvest losses on a calorific basis among all agricultural commodities. As much as 50\%--60\% cereal grains can be lost during the storage stage due only to the lack of technical inefficiency. Use of scientific storage methods can reduce these losses to as low as 1\%--2\%. This paper provides a comprehensive literature review of the grain postharvest losses in developing countries, the status and causes of storage losses and discusses the technological interventions to reduce these losses. The basics of hermetic storage, various technology options, and their effectiveness on several crops in different localities are discussed in detail.},

  abstract = {The use of electrical resistance tomography (ERT) to monitor new environmental remediation processes is addressed. An overview of the ERT method, including design of surveys and interpretation, is given. Proper design and lay-out of boreholes and electrodes are important for successful results. Data are collected using an automated collection system and interpreted using a nonlinear least squares inversion algorithm. Case histories are given for three remediation technologies: Joule (ohmic) heating, in which clay layers are heated electrically; air sparging, the injection of air below the water table; and electrokinetic treatment, which moves ions by applying an electric current. For Joule heating, a case history is given for an experiment near Savannah River, Georgia, USA. The target for Joule heating was a clay layer of variable thickness. During the early stages of heating, ERT images show increases in conductivity due to the increased temperatures. Later, the conductivities decreased as the system became dehydrated. For air sparging, a case history from Florence, Oregon, USA is described. Air was injected into a sandy aquifer at the site of a former service station. Successive images clearly show the changes in shape of the region of air saturation with time. The monitoring of an electrokinetic laboratory test on core samples is shown. The electrokinetic treatment creates a large change in the core resistivity, decreasing near the anode and increasing near the cathode. Although remediation efforts were successful both at Savannah River and at Florence, in neither case did experiments progress entirely as predicted. At Savannah River, the effects of heating and venting were not uniform and at Florence the radius of air flow was smaller than expected. Most sites are not as well characterized as these two sites. Improving remediation methods requires an understanding of the movements of heat, air, fluids and ions in the sub-surface which ERT can provide. The Florence site provides an excellent example of using information from ERT to improve a remediation system design. At Florence, the injection well used too long a sand pack in the injection zone which decreased the injection depth and thus the zone of influence of the system. Though in retrospect this is obvious, it would not have been noticed without ERT.},

  abstract = {During dry periods, stream discharge in vegetated catchments can naturally fluctuate up to 10\% daily. Despite intensive efforts put in observing and interpreting diel fluctuations of stream discharge across a range of instrumented natural catchments worldwide, the capability of state-of-the-art hydrological models to reproduce and explain such processes has rarely been tested. Here, we used CATHY, a physics-based integrated surface-subsurface hydrological model (ISSHM), to simulate the stream discharge in a small tile-drained agricultural catchment in Switzerland, where streamflow diel fluctuations appeared in dry periods. The model was able to satisfactorily reproduce the measured stream discharge, including the observed diel fluctuations. Next, we designed and simulated a series of modelling scenarios aimed to disentangle the processes contributing to the diel fluctuations in stream discharge. These scenarios revealed the predominant role of evapotranspiration (ET) in the establishment of diel fluctuations in stream discharge. Irrigation sustained the baseflow in dry periods and caused short-living streamflow peaks, which did not directly cause, but superposed to, diel patterns. Vegetation rooting depths and response to oxygen stress in the root zone slightly affected the amplitude of the streamflow diel fluctuations, while changes in the saturated hydraulic conductivity driven by diel soil temperature fluctuations caused an amplitude of the streamflow diel signal 10 times smaller compared to the one caused by ET. Our study demonstrates that ISSHMs such as CATHY can provide high-fidelity spatially-distributed dynamic simulations of evapotranspiration and irrigation fluxes, as well as soil moisture and groundwater flows, enhancing our understanding of the role of these hydrological processes during dry periods and thus making these models useful tools for a more sustainable management of agricultural catchments.},

An energy dispersive X-ray (EDAX) technique of analysis was used for characterising metal adsorption sites on the iron-coated sand surface. The results indicated that the iron-coated sand had more micropores and higher speci{\textregistered}c surface area because of the attachment of iron oxide. Copper ions could penetrate into the micropores and mesopores of iron oxide on sand surface, and the regeneration of the iron-coated sand could be achieved by soaking with pH  3.0 acid solution.

  abstract = {Water is considered one of the vital natural resources and factors for performing shortand long-term agricultural practices on Earth. Meanwhile, globally, most of the available freshwater resources are utilized for irrigation purposes in agriculture. Currently, many world regions are facing extreme water shortage problems, which can worsen if not managed properly. In the literature, numerous methods and remedies are used to cope with the increasing global water crises. The use of precision irrigation water-saving systems (PISs) for efficient water management under climate change is one of them and is a highly recommended approach by researchers. It can mitigate the adverse effects of changing climate and help enhance water use efficiency, crop yield, and environmental footprints. Thus, the present study aimed to comprehensively examine and review PISs, focusing on their development, implementation, and positive impacts on sustainable water management. In addition, we searched the literature using different online search engines and reviewed and summarized the main results of the previously published papers on PISs. We discussed the traditional irrigation method and its modernization for enhancing water use efficiency, PIS monitoring and controlling, architecture, data sharing communication technologies, the role of artificial intelligence for irrigation water-saving, and the future prospects of the PIS. Based on the brief literature review, the present study concluded that the future of PISs seems bright, driven by the need for efficient irrigation water management systems, technological advancements, and increasing environmental awareness. As the water scarcity problem intensifies due to climate change and population growth, the PIS is poised to play a critical role in optimizing and modernizing water usage, increasing water use efficiency, and reducing environmental footprints, thus ensuring sustainable agriculture development.},

Demands on soil resources during the 21st century and beyond include: (i) increasing agronomic production to meet the food needs of additional 3.5 billion people that will reside in developing countries along with likely shift in food habits from plant-based to animal-based diet, (ii) producing ligno-cellulosic biomass through establishment of energy plantations on agriculturally surplus/marginal soils or other specifically identified lands, (iii) converting degraded/desertified soils to restorative land use for enhancing biodiversity and improving the environment, (iv) sequestering carbon in terrestrial (soil and trees) and aquatic ecosystems to off-set industrial emissions and stabilize the atmospheric abundance of CO2 and other greenhouse gases, (v) developing farming/cropping systems which improve water use efficiency and minimize risks of water pollution, contamination and eutrophication, and (vi) creating reserves for species preservation, recreation and enhancing aesthetic value of soil resources. Realization of these multifarious soil functions necessitate establishment of inter-disciplinary approach with close linkages between soil scientists and chemists, physicists, geologists, hydrologists, climatologists, biologists, system engineers (nano technologists), computer scientists and information technologists, economists, social scientists and molecular geneticists dealing with human, animal and microbial processes.

  abstract = {Determining the depth and geometry of a landfill's lower boundary is a difficult task. Potential field methods generally lack the necessary depth resolution, and seismic reflection data are usually contaminated by source-generated noise in the time range of interest ({$<$}50 ms). To address this problem, we have developed a surface 2-D tomographic refraction scheme that is based on a fast finite-difference eikonal solver and an inversion method that incorporates appropriate damping and smoothing constraints. This new scheme has been applied to a first-arrival traveltime data set collected across adjacent landfills in northern Switzerland. High-quality seismic data were collected along five profiles that crossed the landfills and two that sampled undisturbed natural sediments. Seismic waves generated from multiple shots were recorded on large numbers of closely spaced receivers during quiet evening periods. Reliability of the resultant velocity tomograms was estimated on the basis of (1) ray diagrams, (2) plots of synthetic and observed traveltimes, (3) traveltime residual analyses, (4) comparisons of coincident velocity-depth profiles computed from intersecting profiles, (5) inversions with diverse input models, and (6) quantitative error analyses using a bootstrap technique. At our study site, the base of the near-surface natural layer and the lower boundaries of the landfills were defined by rapid increases in velocity from {$<$}1000 m/s to {$>$}1500 m/s, with velocities in the upper parts of the models determined to within about {\textpm}100 m/s. The thickness of the near-surface natural layer varied between 2 and 6 m, with occasional thickening to {$\sim$}7 m. In contrast, low velocities associated with the landfills could be traced to 9 to 11 m depth. Although our results have demonstrated that the tomographic refraction scheme may be an efficient and cost-effective means of studying the very shallow subsurface ({$<$}20 m depth), complementary geological and other geophysical data were required to discriminate between velocity anomalies attributed to the landfills and those attributed to natural variations in the near-surface geology.},

  abstract = {The world is banking on a major increase in food production, if the dietary needs and food preferences of an increasing, and increasingly rich, population are to be met. This requires the further expansion of modern agriculture, but modern agriculture rests on a small number of highly productive crops and its expansion has led to a significant loss of global biodiversity. Ecologists have shown that biodiversity loss results in lower plant productivity, while agricultural economists have linked biodiversity loss on farms with increasing variability of crop yields, and sometimes lower mean yields. In this paper we consider the macro-economic consequences of the continued expansion of particular forms of intensive, modern agriculture, with a focus on how the loss of biodiversity affects food production. We employ a quantitative, structurally estimated model of the global economy, which jointly determines economic growth, population and food demand, agricultural innovations and land conversion. We show that even small effects of agricultural expansion on productivity via biodiversity loss might be sufficient to warrant a moratorium on further land conversion.},

Widely used second-generation sequencers have enabled the analysis of extremely diverse microbial communities, the discovery of novel gene functions, and the comprehension of the metabolic interconnections established among microbial consortia. However, the high cost of the sequencers and the complexity of library preparation and sequencing protocols still hamper the application of metagenomic sequencing in a vast range of real-life applications. In this context, the emergence of portable, third-generation sequencers is becoming a popular alternative for the rapid analysis of microbial communities in particular scenarios, due to their low cost, simplicity of operation, and rapid yield of results. This review discusses the main applications of real-time, in situ metagenomic sequencing developed to date, highlighting the relevance of this technology in current challenges (such as the management of global pathogen outbreaks) and in the next future of industry and clinical diagnosis.},

The silica sand possesses only external surface, the area of which increases with decreasing particle size in a predictable relationship based on a model of smooth, uniform, and nonporous spheres. The model incorporates an exper imentally determined roughness factor. Sieve and subsieve size particles of microcrystalline silica, however, are aggregates of tiny crystallites, many of them less than 0.1 {\textbar}ji in diameter. These aggregates are porous and quite permeable to nitrogen, the adsorbate gas. Because of the high permeability, the measured surface area changes surprisingly little with particle size from 100 {\textbar}jl down to 10 jjl. As the particle diameter decreases below 10 n, the surface area increases.},

Surface electrodes placed on the skin need to be robust in order to measure biopotentials from the body reliably and comfortable for extended wearability. The electrical stability of nonpolarizable silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) and its low-cost, commercial production have made these electrodes ubiquitous health sensors in the clinical environment, where wet gels and long wires are accommodated by patient immobility. However, smaller, dry electrodes with wireless acquisition are essential for truly wearable, continuous health sensing. Currently, techniques for the robust fabrication of custom Ag/AgCl electrodes are lacking. Here, we present three methods for the fabrication of Ag/AgCl electrodes: oxidizing Ag in a chlorine solution, electroplating Ag, and curing Ag/AgCl ink. Each of these methods is then used to create three different electrode shapes for wearable application. Bench-top and on-body evaluation of the electrode techniques was achieved by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), calculation of variance in electrocardiogram (ECG) measurements, and analysis of auditory steady-state response (ASSR) measurement. Microstructures produced on the electrode by each fabrication technique were also investigated with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The custom Ag/AgCl electrodes were found to be efficient in comparison with standard, commercial Ag/AgCl wet electrodes across all three of our presented techniques, with Ag/AgCl ink shown to be the better out of the three in benchtop and biometric recordings.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Soil temperature has been recognized as a property that strongly influences a myriad of hydro-biogeochemical processes and reflects how various properties modulate the soil thermal flux. In spite of its importance, our ability to acquire soil temperature data with high spatial and temporal resolution and coverage is limited because of the high cost of equipment, the difficulties of deployment, and the complexities of data management. Here we propose a new strategy that we call distributed temperature profiling (DTP) for improving the characterization and monitoring near-surface thermal properties through the use of an unprecedented number of laterally and vertically distributed temperature measurements. We developed a prototype DTP system, which consists of inexpensive, low-impact, low-power, and vertically resolved temperature probes that independently and autonomously record soil temperature. The DTP system concept was tested by moving sequentially the system across the landscape to identify near-surface permafrost distribution in a discontinuous permafrost environment near Nome, Alaska, during the summertime. Results show that the DTP system enabled successful acquisition of vertically resolved profiles of summer soil temperature over the top 0.8\,m at numerous locations. DTP also enabled high-resolution identification and lateral delineation of near-surface permafrost locations from surrounding zones with no permafrost or deep permafrost table locations overlain by a perennially thawed layer. The DTP strategy overcomes some of the limitations associated with -- and complements the strengths of -- borehole-based soil temperature sensing as well as fiber-optic distributed temperature sensing (FO-DTS) approaches. Combining DTP data with co-located topographic and vegetation maps obtained using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) data allowed us to identify correspondences between surface and subsurface property distribution and in particular between topography, vegetation, shallow soil properties, and near-surface permafrost. Finally, the results highlight the considerable value of the newly developed DTP strategy for investigating the significant variability in and complexity of subsurface thermal and hydrological regimes in discontinuous permafrost regions.},

  abstract = {Quantifying the spatial and temporal dynamics of soil moisture is an important subject in vadose zone hydrology. Although progress has been made to measure soil water content, soil water flow needs to be simulated for many applications. An analytical solution for soil water content, resulting from vertical flow and simplified mathematical conditions and hydraulic properties, was derived with the ColeHopf transformation. The solution serves as a transfer function with the calibrated boundary condition and water content as respective input and output. This transfer function was applied to time series of soil water content, obtained from weekly observations with a neutron probe over a 1282-day period at five depths and 16 locations. Water retention and saturated hydraulic conductivity were measured on soil samples in the laboratory. The transfer function was calibrated to observed time series of soil water content {\texttheta}(t) with a median coefficient of determination R2 = 0.980. It was then used to predict {\texttheta}(t) using constants from the calibration location and hydraulic parameters from the prediction location. There was a fairly good correspondence between predicted and observed {\texttheta}(t) using calibrations elsewhere (R2 = 0.783). As an alternative, an observed time series {\texttheta}(t) was scaled by multiplying it by the ratio of experimental saturated water contents for prediction and observation location. This scaling approach led to poorer predictions (R2 = 0.651). The analytical solution provides a flexible approach to quantify soil moisture for a variety of scenarios regarding available data on topography, climate, soil properties, and soil hydraulic parameters.},

  abstract = {Exclusion-diffusion potentials arising from temperature gradients are widely neglected in self-potential (SP) surveys, despite the ubiquitous presence of temperature gradients in subsurface settings such as volcanoes and hot springs, geothermal fields, and oil reservoirs during production via water or steam injection. Likewise, with the exception of borehole SP logging, exclusion-diffusion potentials arising from concentration gradients are also neglected or, at best, it is assumed that the diffusion potential dominates. To better interpret these SP sources requires well-constrained measurements of the various coupling terms. We report measurements of thermoelectric and electrochemical exclusion-diffusion potentials across sandstones saturated with NaCl brine and find that electrode effects can dominate the measured voltage. After correcting for these, we find that Hittorf transport numbers are the same within experimental error regardless of whether ion transport occurs in response to temperature or concentration gradients over the range of NaCl concentration investigated that is typical of natural systems. Diffusion potentials dominate only if the pore throat radius is more than approximately 4000 times larger than the diffuse layer thickness. In fine-grained sandstones with small pore throat diameter, this condition is likely to be met only if the saturating brine is of relatively high salinity; thus, in many cases of interest to earth scientists, exclusion-diffusion potentials will comprise significant contributions from both ionic diffusion through, and ionic exclusion from, the pore space of the rock. However, in coarse-grained sandstones, or sandstones saturated with high-salinity brine, exclusion-diffusion potentials can be described using end-member models in which ionic exclusion is neglected. Exclusion-diffusion potentials in sandstones depend upon pore size and salinity in a complex way: they may be positive, negative, or zero depending upon sandstone rock texture (expressed here by the pore radius r) and salinity.},

  abstract = {In anaerobic environments microorganisms exchange electrons with community members and with soil and groundwater compounds. Interspecies electron transfer (IET) occurs by several mechanisms: diffusion of redox compounds or direct contact between cells. This latter mechanism may be facilitated by the presence of conductive nanoparticles (NP), possibly serving as electron conduits among microorganisms. Our study examined the effect of magnetite (Fe3O4) NP on the dechlorination of 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCA) by a mixed-culture. The addition of NP (170 mg L-1 total Fe) enhanced the acetate-driven reductive dechlorination of 1,2-DCA to harmless ethene (via reductive dihaloelimination) up to 3.3-times (2.3 {$\mu$}eq L-1 d-1 vs. 0.7 {$\mu$}eq L-1 d-1), while decreasing the lag time by 0.8 times (23 days) when compared to unamended (magnetite-free) microcosms. Dechlorination activity was correlated with the abundance of Dehalococcoides mccartyi, which accounted up to 50\% of total bacteria as quantified by CARD-FISH analysis, pointing to a key role of this microorganism in the process. Given the widespread abundance of conductive minerals in the environment, the results of this study may provide new insights into the fate of 1,2-DCA and suggest new tools for its remediation by linking biogeochemical mechanisms. {\copyright} 2017 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {The dynamics of carbon dioxide fluxes in the high-altitude Alpine Critical Zone is only partially understood. The complex geomorphology induces significant spatial heterogeneity, and a strong interannual variability is present in the often-extreme climatic and environmental conditions of Alpine ecosystems. To explore the relative importance of the spatial and temporal variability of CO               2               fluxes, we analysed a set of in-situ measurements obtained during the summers from 2018 to 2021 in four sampling plots, characterised by soils with different underlying bedrock within the same watershed in the Nivolet plain, in the Gran Paradiso National Park, western Italian Alps. Multi-regression models of CO               2               emission and uptake were built using measured meteo-climatic and environmental variables considering either individual years (aggregating over plots) or individual plots (aggregating over years). We observed a significant variability of the model parameters across the different years, while such variability was much smaller across different plots. Significant changes between the different years mainly concerned the temperature dependence of respiration (CO               2               emission) and the light dependence of photosynthesis (CO               2               uptake). These results suggest that spatial upscaling can be obtained from site measurements, but long-term flux monitoring is required to properly capture the temporal variability at interannual scales.},

Silica dispersion remained dispersed at its point of zero charge (pzc) of pH {$\sim$}2.0 (CR1). Adsorbed hydrolysis products of Cu2+ and Al3+ caused the dispersion to display two further points of charge reversal (CR2 and CR3) at moderate ions concentration. CR2 occurred near the pH for the formation of the first hydrolysis product. This pH is about 2.8 for Al3+ and 5.0 for Cu2+. For all three metal ions, CR3 approached the pzc of the metal hydroxides at complete surface coverage. At CR3, the dispersions displayed a maximum yield stress. As many as three type of attractive forces; bridging, charged patch and van der Waals, may account for the maximum yield stress at low surface coverage. At complete coverage, only the van der Waals force is in play---the adsorbed hydrolysis products must have increased significantly the effective Hamaker constant of silica. With Al3+ the yield stress was absent at CR2 because particle bridging and charged patch attraction are unimportant as the silica surface charge is near zero. Adsorption of strongly hydrolysed Th4+ ions at pH {$<$} 2.0 caused the dispersion to display only one pzc (CR3).},

  abstract = {We propose an electrical triple-layer model (TLM) to describe the electrochemical properties of clay minerals. This model includes a speciation model of the active crystallographic surface sites plus a classical description of the Stern and diffuse layers. In addition to the surface charges associated with the surface groups (aluminols, silanols, and {$>$}Al--O--Si{$<$} sites), the model takes into account the degree of isomorphic substitution rate inside the crystalline network. The model computes both the {$\zeta$} potential and the low-frequency (few kHz) surface conductivity as these two properties are equally important to interpret electrokinetic properties of colloids and clay-rich porous materials. For surface conductivity, the model comprises two contributions; one is associated with the Stern layer (dynamic Stern layer) and the second is associated with the excess of counterions located in the diffuse Gouy--Chapman layer. The parameters of the TLM model are optimized using the Simplex algorithm. Comparison between the model and the experimental data shows good agreement for a reasonable choice of parameters close to the a priori values determined from quartz and gibbsite. Surface conductivity of smectite appears rather independent of salinity, while for kaolinite, surface conductivity increases with salinity. In both cases, the Stern layer contribution to surface conductivity dominates but the contribution associated with the diffuse layer cannot be neglected.},

  abstract = {The low-frequency conductivity response of water-saturated packs of glass beads reflects a combination of two processes. One process corresponds to the polarization of the mineral/water interface coating the surface of the grains. The other process corresponds to the Maxwell--Wagner polarization associated with accumulation of the electrical charges in the pore space of the composite medium. A model of low-frequency conductivity dispersion is proposed. This model is connected to a triple-layer model of electrochemical processes occurring at the surface of silica. This model accounts for the partition of the counterions between the Stern and the diffuse layers. The polarization of the mineral/water interface is modeled by the electrochemical polarization model of Schurr for a spherical grain. We take into account also the DC surface conductivity contribution of protons of the sorbed water and the contribution of the diffuse layer. At the scale of a macroscopic representative elementary volume of the porous material, the electrochemical polarization of a single grain is convoluted with the grain size distribution of the porous material. Finally, the Maxwell--Wagner polarization is modeled using the complex conductivity of a granular porous medium obtained from the differential effective medium theory. The predictions of this model agree well with experimental data of spectral induced polarization. Two peaks are observed at low frequencies in the spectrum of the phase. The first peak corresponds to the distribution of the size of the beads and the second peak is due to the roughness of the grains.},

We measure the complex conductivity and the time domain IP responses of Berea sandstone as a function of pore fluid ionie strength and pH. Complex conductivity is measured over the frequency range 10-3 to 106 Hz, and chargeability is computed using a time window of 0.16 to 1.74 s. Tue field IP parameters: phase, percent frequency effect, and chargeability are functions ofboth the surface and bulk electrical properties of the sample andare observed to decrease with increasing solution conductivity. Dividing these parameters by the sample resistivity yields normalized IP parameters (quadrature conductivity, metal factor, normalized chargeability) that are proportional to the imaginary component ofthe complex surface conductivity. Normalized IP parameters increase with ionie strength up to concentrations of 10-1 MNaCl and show a reduced response at pH 3, the point of zero charge for quartz-dominated systems. For concentrations {$>$} 10-1 MNaCl, the normalized parameters decrease with increasing concentration. This decrease in surface polarization may indicate a decrease in the effective mobility of polarizing charges at high solution concentration. Our data indicate that normalized IP parameters are directly related to the physiochemical parameters that contro\} the surface conductivity responses of rocks and soils. Normalization of IP measurements in environmental investigations should increase the effectiveness of IP surveys, especially in high-conductivity environments.},

  abstract = {Soil texture and its vertical spatial heterogeneity may greatly influence soil hydraulic properties and the distribution of water and solutes in the soil profile; therefore, they are of great importance for agricultural, environmental, and geoengineering applications such as land reclamation and landfill construction. This paper reviews the following aspects on water and salt dynamics in the presence of a water table: (i) the effect of soil texture on the extent of upward movement of groundwater in homogenous soils and (ii) the impact of soil textural layering on water and salt dynamics. For a homogenous soil, the maximum height of capillary rise (hmax) or the evaporation characteristic length (ECL) is closely related to the soil texture. When the water table is deeper than hmax, water will evaporate at some depth below surface and salts will be retained below the evaporation front, causing the separation of water and salt. For layered soils, flow barriers (capillary and hydraulic barriers) can make the soil hold more water than a nonlayered one. A capillary barrier may work when a fine-textured layer overlies a coarse-textured layer during infiltration or a coarse-textured layer overlies a fine-textured layer during evaporation, and a hydraulic barrier may occur when a poorly permeable layer exists in the soil profile. The extra water held by flow barriers may improve water availability to plants and may at the same time increase salinization and other environmental risks. Under special conditions, such as in seasonally frozen soils with a shallow water table, there is an additional soil salinization incentive caused by freeze--thaw cycles. Above all, further research is needed to understand the complex effects of soil texture and layering on water and salt dynamics, especially in artificial soils such as reclaimed soils with contrasting properties.},

However, models cannot accurately reproduce local climate effects due to their coarse spatial resolution and uncertainties, and field observations are valuable but often insufficient due to their limited coverage. Here we present new evidence acquired from global satellite data to analyse the biophysical effects of forests on local climate. Results show that tropical forests have a strong cooling effect throughout the year; temperate forests show moderate cooling in summer and moderate warming in winter with net cooling annually; and boreal forests have strong warming in winter and moderate cooling in summer with net warming annually. The spatiotemporal cooling or warming effects are mainly driven by the two competing biophysical effects, evapotranspiration and albedo, which in turn are strongly influenced by rainfall and snow. Implications of our satellite-based study could be useful for informing local forestry policies.},

Moreover, the kinetic parameters (activation energy and pre-exponential factor) of the mixtures of calcium carbonate and organic acids were determined using the Coats--Redfern method. It is indicated that the decomposition process of calcium carbonate containing different organic acids includes three or four weight loss processes. In the zone of 370--450 {$^\circ$}C, energy is released due to the combustion of organic products decomposed from organic salts, and energy increases with the increase of molecular weight of organic acid. Activation energy of the samples containing citric acid, oxalic acid and tartaric acid is decreased by 34.9\%, 28.8\% and 31.9\%, respectively. The results may be used to provide a useful basis for further applying industrial wastes containing different organic acids in cement industries with high-efficiency.},

Irrigation is essential for maintaining food production in water-scarce regions. The irrigation need depends on the water content of the soil, which we measured with the novel technique of cosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRNS). The potential of the CRNS technique for drip irrigation scheduling was explored in this study for the Picassent site near Valencia, Spain. To support the experimental evidence, the neutron transport simulation URANOS was used to simulate the effect of drip irrigation on the neutron counts. The overall soil water content (SWC) in the CRNS footprint was characterized with a root mean square error {$<$}0.03 cm                 3                 /cm                 3                 , but the experimental dataset indicated methodological limitations to detect drip water input. Both experimental data and simulation results suggest that the large-area neutron response to drip irrigation is insignificant in our specific case using a standard CRNS probe. Because of the small area of irrigated patches and short irrigation time, the limited SWC changes due to drip irrigation were not visible from the measured neutron intensity changes. Our study shows that CRNS modeling can be used to assess the suitability of the CRNS technique for certain applications. While the standard CRNS probe was not able to detect small-scale drip irrigation patterns, the method might be applicable for larger irrigated areas, in drier regions, and for longer and more intense irrigation periods. Since statistical noise is the main limitation of the CRNS measurement, the capability of the instrument could be improved in future studies by larger and more efficient neutron detectors.},

CMS-SS was used as an efficient adsorbent for removal of cationic dyes [methyl blue (MB) and crystal violet (CV)] and metal ions [cupper(II), Cu(II)] from water in respective single and binary systems. Compared with the anionized-starch without silica sand, CMS-SS shows evidently improved adsorption capacities, i.e. approximately 653.31 {\textpm} 27.30, 1246.40 {\textpm} 34.10, and 383.08 {\textpm} 13.50 mg{$\cdot$}g-1, for MB, CV, and Cu(II), respectively, ascribed to the additional carboxyl groups. The isotherms and kinetics study indicated that the Langmuir model and the pseudo-second-order model were more suitable. The adsorption process is thus a homogeneous monolayer chemisorption. The adsorptions of these three pollutants are spontaneous and exothermal processes driven by increasing entropy. The adsorption behaviors of CMS-SS have high pH dependence, and electrostatic attraction play an important role in adsorption. Dyes showed higher affinity to CMS-SS than metal ions causing a preferential adsorption of dye over Cu(II) in their aqueous mixture. This adsorbent after saturated adsorption could be rapidly separated from water due to its enlarged density after embedded silica sand; moreover, those rapidly recovered adsorbents were tried to use as new adsorbents for removal of an anionic dye from water due to the complete changes in their surface structures after saturated adsorption.},

Direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) has been proposed as a pathway that may enhance AD performance by increasing electron transfer efficiency. This paper comprehensively reviews the main principles and mechanisms of DIET between syntrophic bacteria and methanogens in AD, summarizes strategies for the regulation and enhancement of DIET in AD, and discusses the role of DIET in improving AD efficiency. Literature research demonstrate that c-type cytochromes and e-pili are two major functional components for the cell-to-cell electron transfer and the supplementation of ethanol-enriched substrates along with conductive materials have been proven to be efficient for DIET establishment. It is also confirmed that DIET has the great potential for shortening the startup period, promoting organic degradation, and enhancing methane production in the AD of organic waste. Furthermore, the main knowledge gaps in the profound understanding of DIET, including the effect of multimedia environment, the establishment of mathematical model and the realization of engineering application, are identified, and the future perspectives are proposed for DIET applications in the AD of organic waste. This paper thus highlights important references and directions that will support research to enhance the DIET pathway and therefore the AD of organic waste.},

  abstract = {In this paper, the Maxwell--Wagner effect and the charge characteristics of the heterogeneous interface at the action of higher electric field and elevated temperature are investigated by means of electret technology. A composite membrane with a double-layer structure of a polypropylene (PP) film and a fluorinated ethylene propylene copolymer (FEP) film was made. After being polarized under electric field and elevated temperature, the component PP and FEP films of the composite membranes were separated. The charge density of the PP and FEP films was measured to analyze the characteristics of interfacial charge in the composite membrane. Experimental results directly prove that the charge characteristics at the interface of the composite membranes are consistent with the result calculated by the Maxwell--Wagner effect. The polarity of the interfacial charge can be switched by changing the polarity of the polarizing voltage. The characteristics of the accumulated interfacial charge are strongly dependent on the conductivity, which is affected by the temperature and the polarizing electric field. A new phenomenon, that is, the measured charge density is much higher than that calculated by the Maxwell--Wagner effect, is found. The reason is ascribed to the electret effect from the FEP and PP films. This research provides a new insight into the charge characteristics at the heterogeneous interface.},

The real and imaginary parts of the complex electrical impedance are obtained by using the Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) technique. The amplitude of the AC applied voltage is 20.0 mV. The complex electrical impedance results of the solutions are modeled by using an equivalent electrical circuit with a good agreement with the experimental data. This proposed circuit is composed by three sections connected in series. The first one is composed by a parallel RC associated with bulk effects, the second section is composed by a capacitor in parallel to a constant phase element (CPE) associated with the electric double-layer and the last one section composed by a resistance in series with an inductor associated with resistances of the electrical contacts and with parasites inductances of the connected cables. The components of the equivalent circuit are investigated as a function of salt concentration. As additional results, the electrical conductivity and complex permittivity of the samples are calculated and the electrical properties of the solutions are investigated as a function of kind of cations. For both K+ and Na+ cations, the bulk effects are well described by Debye model. However, the electric double-layer shows a higher resistance associated with cation Na+ than that associated to cation K+. Even for very low concentrations of salt, for both salts, it was observed an inverse relationship between impedance and salt concentration.},

One rational and cost-effective method may be the implementation of increased agricultural crop diversification. Crop diversification can improve resilience in a variety of ways: by engendering a greater ability to suppress pest outbreaks and dampen pathogen transmission, which may worsen under future climate scenarios, as well as by buffering crop production from the effects of greater climate variability and extreme events. Such benefits point toward the obvious value of adopting crop diversification to improve resilience, yet adoption has been slow. Economic incentives encouraging production of a select few crops, the push for biotechnology strategies, and the belief that monocultures are more productive than diversified systems have been hindrances in promoting this strategy. However, crop diversification can be implemented in a variety of forms and at a variety of scales, allowing farmers to choose a strategy that both increases resilience and provides economic benefits.},

However, these systems suffer from the imbalance calibration of load cell sensors, high cost of hardware installation, and low positioning accuracy. Therefore, we propose an accurate online Weighing Distribution Positional Model that enables accurate load cell calibration and tracks item position and weight on shelves utilizing the load cells sensor fusion and deep learning. The load cell sensors are used to weigh shelves, and cameras are used to record the item's movement which is analyzed by image processing. Four well-known machine learning algorithms are tested on the system to identify the best operative environment. The system and the algorithms are evaluated using a real-world dataset consisting of item weights, and the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was found more accurate than the others with 97.61\% accuracy and zero error tolerance.},

  abstract = {Localizing leaks of water and fluids from storage tanks and water reservoirs with geomembranes is an important task for a variety of environmental applications and water resources applications. The minimally intrusive mise{\`a}-la-masse method is used to detect leaks with the current injected inside the reservoir and a return current electrode located remotely. We test a new approach for the inversion of the voltage data using sandbox experiments and numerical modeling. A method similar to the self-potential inversion method is proposed to inverse the voltages recorded around the tank or reservoir. A global objective function with a data misfit term and regularization term is minimized to invert the voltages. In the inversion process, a depth-weighting matrix is used to strengthen the depth resolution of the current source, and the minimum support method is used to avoid oversmoothed results in terms of leak detection. The distributions of electrical current density on the walls of reservoir indicate the position of leaks. The results show that the inversion method with source compaction accurately identifies the location of single leaks. For two separated leaks, there is an obvious bias for the deeper hole and the bias increases with its depth. For three holes, the source compaction method generally identifies the location of the three leaks when their depth ranges are similar. When one of the leaks becomes deeper, localization of the deeper one becomes more difficult. The influence of the size of the leak on the inversion results is also investigated. The inversion algorithm overestimates the depth of small leaks while it slightly underestimates the depth of large leaks. For a leak having the form of a crack, the inversion results using the source compaction method agree with the position of the leak and its shape.},

We have used measurements from an eddy correlation system to derive the aerodynamic resistance to heat transfer over a bare soil surface as well as over a maize canopy. Diurnal variations of aerodynamic resistance have been analyzed. The results showed that the diurnal variation of aerodynamic resistance during daytime (07:00 h--18:00 h) was significant for both the bare soil surface and the maize canopy although the range of variation was limited. Based on the measurements made by the eddy correlation system, a comprehensive evaluation of eight popularly used parameterization schemes of aerodynamic resistance was carried out. The roughness length for heat transfer is a crucial parameter in the estimation of aerodynamic resistance to heat transfer and can neither be taken as a constant nor be neglected. Comparing with the measurements, the parameterizations by Choudhury et al. (1986), Viney (1991), Yang et al. (2001) and the modified forms of Verma et al. (1976) and Mahrt and Ek (1984) by inclusion of roughness length for heat transfer gave good agreements with the measurements, while the parameterizations by Hatfield et al. (1983) and Xie (1988) showed larger errors even though the roughness length for heat transfer has been taken into account.},

  abstract = {Drought has been a major limiting factor affecting agricultural production in the world. Accurately quantitative analysis of the dynamic changes of evapotranspiration and soil water balance is very important for effectively managing water resources and improving water use efficiency under water scarcity. Soil water balance for perennial forage is more complex than the annuals due to stronger roots and periodic evapotranspiration. The objective was to explore the evapotranspiration characteristics and soil water balance of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) grasslands under border irrigation at different stand ages and irrigation treatments. A 3-yr field experiment with a full irrigation and 6 regulated deficit irrigation treatments was conducted, and growth-related indicators, soil evaporation and soil water dynamics were observed regularly. Daily evapotranspiration and soil water balance were computed using a modified dual-Kc model which is able to simulate evaporation and transpiration separately. The results showed that soil water simulated by the model and the measured value were in good agreement, and regression coefficients were higher than 0.6 and close to 1.0 in most cuts. The change trend of root zone water under deficit irrigation at single growth stages was similar to that under full irrigation. Under irrigation, the transpiration was the main water loss of alfalfa grasslands. The daily actual evapotranspiration of alfalfa in the 1st cut was higher than 8.0 mm d- 1 and even over 15.0 mm d- 1 at the middle and later growth stages. In contrast, in the 2nd and 3rd cut, it was always less than 10.0 mm d- 1. The daily actual evapotrans\- piration decreased significantly and immediately after cutting, and daily actual transpiration was reduced to less than 1.0 mm d- 1. The change trend of daily actual evapotranspiration under deficit irrigation at single growth stages was also similar to that under full irrigation. The seasonal evapotranspiration could reach 800 mm and was reduced by deficit irrigation. The average proportion of soil evaporation to total evapotranspiration was 18\%. With the decrease of irrigation amount, the evapotranspiration, transpiration and irrigation water compensation decreased, while evaporation remained relatively stable and the ratio of evaporation to evapo\- transpiration increased. A lower relative evapotranspiration deficit (0.041) was obtained under moderate deficit irrigation at the budding stage than those in other deficit cases (0.086 or over). In conclusion, in the arid and semi-arid areas, deficit irrigation could be applied to alfalfa grassland at the budding stage in alfalfa production.},

  abstract = {For effective irrigation and fertilization management, the knowledge of substrate hydraulic properties is essential. In this study, a steady-state laboratory method was used to determine simultaneously the water retention curve, u(h), and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity as a function of volumetric water content, K(u), and water pressure head, K(h), of five substrates used widely in horticulture. The substrates examined were pure peat, 75/25 peat/perlite, 50/50 peat/perlite, 50/50 coir/perlite, and pure perlite. The experimental retention curve results showed that in the case of peat and its mixtures with perlite, there is a hysteresis between drying and wetting branches of the retention curve. Whereas in the case of coir/perlite and perlite, the phenomenon of hysteresis was less pronounced. The increase of perlite proportion in the peat/perlite mixtures led to a decrease of total porosity and water-holding capacity and an increase of air space. Study of the K(u) and K(h) experimental data showed that the hysteresis phenomenon of K(u) was negligible compared with the K(h) data for all substrates examined. Within a narrow range of water pressure head (0 to --70 cm H2O) that occurs between two successive irrigations, a sharp decrease of the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity was observed. The comparison of the K(u) experimental data between the peat-based substrate mixtures and the coir-based substrate mixture showed that for water contents lower than 0.40 m3{\'A}m--3, the hydraulic conductivity of the 50/50 coir/perlite mixture was greater. The comparison between experimental water retention curves and predictions using Brooks-Corey and van Genuchten models showed a high correlation (0.992 \# R2 \# 1) for both models for all substrates examined. On the other hand, in the case of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity, the comparison showed a relatively good correlation (0.951 \# R2 \# 0.981) for the van Genuchten-Mualem model for all substrates used except perlite and a significant deviation (0.436 \# R2 \# 0.872) for the Brooks-Corey model for all substrates used.},

  abstract = {Direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) has biogeochemical significance, and practical applications that rely on DIET or DIET-based aspects of microbial physiology are growing. Mechanisms for DIET have primarily been studied in defined cocultures in which Geobacter species are one of the DIET partners. Electrically conductive pili (e-pili) can be an important electrical conduit for DIET. However, there may be instances in which electrical contacts are made between electron transport proteins associated with the outer membranes of the partners. Alternatively, DIET partners can plug into conductive carbon materials, such as granular activated carbon, carbon cloth, and biochar, for long-range electron exchange without the need for e-pili. Magnetite promotes DIET, possibly by acting as a substitute for outer-surface c-type cytochromes. DIET is the primary mode of interspecies electron exchange in some anaerobic digesters converting wastes to methane. Promoting DIET with conductive materials shows promise for stabilizing and accelerating methane production in digesters, permitting higher organic loading rates. Various lines of evidence suggest that DIET is important in terrestrial wetlands, which are an important source of atmospheric methane. DIET may also have a role in anaerobic methane oxidation coupled to sulfate reduction, an important control on methane releases. The finding that DIET can serve as the source of electrons for anaerobic photosynthesis further broadens its potential environmental significance. Microorganisms capable of DIET are good catalysts for several bioelectrochemical technologies and e-pili are a promising renewable source of electronic materials. The study of DIET is in its early stages, and additional investigation is required to better understand the diversity of microorganisms that are capable of DIET, the importance of DIET to carbon and electron flow in anaerobic environments, and the biochemistry and physiology of DIET.},

  abstract = {Despite the widely accepted notion that water potential is the fundamental variable for describing soil--water interactions in soil under unsaturated conditions, it is unable to describe several basic soil properties and behaviors such as pore-water pressure, soil water density, and phase changes of soil water. A variable with greater explanatory power, sorptive potential, is conceptualized as the origin of matric potential and pore-water pressure. The sorptive potential is the sum of the locally varying electromagnetic potentials comprising van der Waals attraction, electrical double-layer repulsion, and surface and cation hydration. Local thermodynamic energy equilibrium dictates that the sorptive potential is always transformed or equal to matric potential minus the pressure potential within a representative elementary volume of matric potential. Limited verification was demonstrated by reducing the sorptive potential to the two well-established concepts of disjoining pressure and osmotic swelling pressure. A parametric study was conducted to illustrate how soil and pore-fluid properties affect sorptive and pressure potentials, indicating that the pore-water pressure under unsaturated conditions can be as high as 0.6 GPa. Such locally high pore-water pressure is induced by the sorptive potential and provides an explanation for phenomena such as abnormally high soil water density, supercooling, and decreased cavitation observed in fine-grained soils.

  abstract = {Check dams have been used throughout the world for a variety of purposes including torrent control, water supply enhancement, agricultural land development, and watershed restoration. National, regional and local governments have invested, and continue to invest, in basin scale erosion-control projects that may include both maintenance of existing and construction of new check dams. The functions of these structures are diverse and vary depending on the geomorphic context where the structures are built. However, although the number of check dams constructed to control floods, regulate sediment transport, reduce upstream reach slopes and sta\- bilize torrent beds continues to increase, some projects have experienced disappointing results, and thus project objectives are not achieved. Causes of failure include poor construction quality, inadequate check dam location and lack of adequate design criteria. These failures lead to reduced confidence in using check dams as restoration tools. Moreover, both construction of dense networks of check dams and construction of a few large open structures require major economic investments, however a comprehensive evaluation of their long-term effec\- tiveness is still lacking. This review aims to achieve a detailed synthesis of the effects of check dams based on a review of the literature that includes conceptual thinking, field observations and numerical approaches. Using the knowledge gaps identified in this work as a starting point, the review is an effort to join and share scientific and technical information from a variety of sites throughout the world based on the legacy effects of check dams. The role of complex interactions between ecological impacts, geomorphic processes and engineering activities is also highlighted. Overall, this review identifies the self-similar character of check dams and the process feedback loops they initiate across a range of spatial scales and geographic settings.},

  abstract = {Over the last century, leaps in technology for imaging, sampling, detection, high-throughput sequencing, and -omics analyses have revolutionized microbial ecology to enable rapid acquisition of extensive datasets for microbial communities across the ever-increasing temporal and spatial scales. The present challenge is capitalizing on our enhanced abilities of observation and integrating diverse data types from different scales, resolutions, and disciplines to reach a causal and mechanistic understanding of how microbial communities transform and respond to perturbations in the environment. This type of causal and mechanistic understanding will make predictions of microbial community behavior more robust and actionable in addressing microbially mediated global problems. To discern drivers of microbial community assembly and function, we recognize the need for a conceptual, quantitative framework that connects measurements of genomic potential, the environment, and ecological and physical forces to rates of microbial growth at specific locations. We describe the Framework for Integrated, Conceptual, and Systematic Microbial Ecology (FICSME), an experimental design framework for conducting process-focused microbial ecology studies that incorporates biological, chemical, and physical drivers of a microbial system into a conceptual model. Through iterative cycles that advance our understanding of the coupling across scales and processes, we can reliably predict how perturbations to microbial systems impact ecosystem-scale processes or vice versa. We describe an approach and potential applications for using the FICSME to elucidate the mechanisms of globally important ecological and physical processes, toward attaining the goal of predicting the structure and function of microbial communities in chemically complex natural environments.},

  abstract = {Background: The application of surface complexation models (SCMs) to natural sediments and soils is hindered by a lack of consistent models and data for large suites of metals and minerals of interest. Furthermore, the surface complexation approach has mostly been developed and tested for single solid systems. Few studies have extended the SCM approach to systems containing multiple solids. Results: Cu adsorption was measured on pure hydrous ferric oxide (HFO), pure kaolinite (from two sources) and in systems containing mixtures of HFO and kaolinite over a wide range of pH, ionic strength, sorbate/sorbent ratios and, for the mixed solid systems, using a range of kaolinite/ HFO ratios. Cu adsorption data measured for the HFO and kaolinite systems was used to derive diffuse layer surface complexation models (DLMs) describing Cu adsorption. Cu adsorption on HFO is reasonably well described using a 1-site or 2-site DLM. Adsorption of Cu on kaolinite could be described using a simple 1-site DLM with formation of a monodentate Cu complex on a variable charge surface site. However, for consistency with models derived for weaker sorbing cations, a 2site DLM with a variable charge and a permanent charge site was also developed. Conclusion: Component additivity predictions of speciation in mixed mineral systems based on DLM parameters derived for the pure mineral systems were in good agreement with measured data. Discrepancies between the model predictions and measured data were similar to those observed for the calibrated pure mineral systems. The results suggest that quantifying specific interactions between HFO and kaolinite in speciation models may not be necessary. However, before the component additivity approach can be applied to natural sediments and soils, the effects of aging must be further studied and methods must be developed to estimate reactive surface areas of solid constituents in natural samples.},

  abstract = {The increase in atmosphere carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations has been the most important environmental change experienced by agricultural systems. It is still uncertain whether grain yield of the global food crop of maize will remain unchanged under a future elevated CO2 (eCO2) environment. A coupled device with climate chamber and weighing lysimeters was developed to explore the water-related yield responses of maize to eCO2. Two experiments were conducted via this device under eCO2 (700 ppm) and current CO2 (400 ppm) concentrations. Seasonal changes in multiple growth indicators and related hydrological processes were compared between these two experiments. The results showed that the eCO2 effects were not significant on several indicators, i.e., the leaf carbon (C) content, nitrogen (N) content, chlorophyll content, C/N ratio, net photosynthesis rate, and leaf area index over the entire growing season (p N 0.05). Nevertheless, the transpiration rate (Tr) significantly reduced during the seedling to filling stages but notably increased at the maturity stage due to eCO2 (p b 0.05). Significant reduction in crop height (mean of 15.9\%, p b 0.05) associated with notable increases in stem diameter (mean of 14.9\%, p b 0.05) were found throughout the growing season. Dry matter per corncob at the final harvest decreased slightly under eCO2 (mean of 7.7 g, p N 0.05). Soil water storage was not significantly conserved by the decline of Tr except during the filling stage. Soil evaporation was likely promoted by eCO2 that the total evapotranspiration changed little (1.2\%) over the entire growing season. Although the leaf water use efficiency increased significantly at every growth stage (mean of 27.3\%, p b 0.05), the grain yield and water productivity were not improved noticeably by eCO2. This study could provide significant insight into predicting future crop yield and hydrological changes under climate change.},

  abstract = {Successful geologic storage of CO2, whether in a carbon capture, utilization, and storage process or as part of enhanced oil recovery (EOR) operations, requires careful monitoring of the concentration of CO2 within the reservoir. Because injected CO2 is more electrically resistive than the in-situ brines and pore fluids in most storage sites, electromagnetic (EM) methods are well suited to map the distribution of injected CO2 over time. In particular, utilizing existing metallic well casings as electrodes to channel current to formation depth and measuring the resulting electrical and magnetic fields at the surface is an effective technique to image the deep and thin reservoirs of interest. This paper describes the theory behind the well-casing source EM method and discusses a series of field surveys carried out over a three-year period using the method to measure CO2 concentration at an EOR site in West Hastings, Texas. The surveys identify resistive zones that agree with the injection locations and geologic structure of the reservoir and show an increase in reservoir resistivity related to CO2 concentration between the initial field status and the middle survey. However, they also show an unexpected decrease in the resistivity within the reservoir between the last two surveys, which may be due to changes in survey parameters or CO2 injection patterns during that interval.},

  abstract = {The ability of plants to supply water to their leaves is intimately associated with survival. Water supply to leaves depends on maintaining an intact water column in the xylem from the roots to shoots. Because this hydraulic pathway is under tension, it is vulnerable to breakage through the induction of air emboli (cavitation). Although the physiological benefit of resistance to water-stress-induced xylem cavitation for desiccation tolerance is clear, there is considerable interspecific variation within and across climates. To understand the adaptive significance of this variation and the potential trade-off with water transport, we compiled a database of 167 species from 50 seed plant families and examined relationships among resistance to xylem cavitation, water transport capacity (as determined by the specific conductivity of xylem [KS]), and climate. Relationships were evaluated using standard cross-species correlations (r). Because inferences about the adaptive significance of these correlations can be biased by the potential similarity of closely related species, we also analyzed our data using phylogenetically independent contrast correlations (PIC) calculated over a range of alternate seed plant phylogenies. Resistance to cavitation, expressed as the xylem tension at which 50\% of hydraulic conductivity was lost ({$\notslash$}50), ranged from Ϫ0.18 to Ϫ9.9 MPa for angiosperms and from Ϫ1.5 to Ϫ14.1 MPa for conifers. Conifers were most resistant to cavitation, with mean {$\notslash$}50 80\% more negative than angiosperms. In contrast, KS was 270\% higher in angiosperms than conifers. Across all species, cavitation resistance increased with decreasing mean annual precipitation. However, significant phylogenetically independent contrast correlations between {$\notslash$}50 and annual precipitation were found within the evergreen angiosperms and conifers but not in the deciduous angiosperms. Thus, the adaptive significance of increased resistance to cavitation as a mechanism of drought tolerance may be of primary importance in evergreen angiosperms and conifers. In contrast, analysis of independent contrasts indicated that KS increased with decreasing rainfall in deciduous angiosperms, whereas there was no association between KS and water availability for evergreen angiosperms and conifers. These results suggest that the evolution of increased KS may be a critical adaptation to water limitation in deciduous angiosperms. Although there was a significant cross-species correlation between {$\notslash$}50 and KS, this relationship was not supported by the independent contrast correlation, suggesting that the evolutionary basis for a trade-off between cavitation resistance and water transport capacity is weak.},

The aim of our investigation was to (a) find a field protocol that provides SIP imaging data sets less affected by electromagnetic coupling and easy to deploy in rough terrains, (b) cover the spatial extent of the local permafrost distribution, and (c) evaluate the potential of the spectral data to discriminate between different substrates and spatial variations in the volumetric ice content within the talus slope. To qualitatively assess data uncertainty, we analyse the misfit between normal and reciprocal (N\&R) measurements collected for all profiles and frequencies. A comparison between different cable setups reveals the lowest N\&R misfits for coaxial cables and the possibility of collecting high-quality SIP data in the range between 0.1--75 Hz. We observe an overall smaller spatial extent of the ice-rich permafrost body compared to its assumed distribution from previous studies. Our results further suggest that SIP data help to improve the discrimination between ice-rich permafrost and unfrozen bedrock in ambiguous cases based on their characteristic spectral behaviour, with ice-rich areas showing a stronger polarization towards higher frequencies in agreement with the well-known spectral response of ice.},

  abstract = {The Bowen ratio-energy balance (BREB) and the stabilitycorrected aerodynamic method were used to estimate turbulent fluxes of sensible and latent heat at an irrigated alfalfa site in a semi-arid valley in northern Utah, U.S.A., during August and September of 1991. Despite inclusion of a generalizedstabilityfactor,the aerodynamicmethod underestimated the daytime (sunrise-sunset) sensible and latent heat fluxes by approximately 3070 in comparison with the BREB method. The sum of the aerodynamic estimates of sensibleand latent heat seldombalanced the energyavaiable from net radiation and change in storage. Wind speed was low during the experiment (averaging 1.6m s-i), and so a second analysis was run for data from daytime, non-rainy, turbulent conditions (wind{$>$} 1.5m s-1). This showed that sensibleand latent heat werestillunderestimatedby approximately 3070 in comparison with the BREB approach. This suggests that underestimation of sensible and latent heat fluxes by the aerodynamic method was not related to the wind speed conditions during the experiment. These results show that the stability-correctedaerodynamicmodeldid not agree with the Bowen ratio method in this experiment. It appears unlikelythat the discrepanciesresultedfrommeasurement errors. Perhaps the theoretical foundation of the similarityparameters (stabilityfunctions)in the aerodynamic model are not sufficientlygeneralized. The discrepancies found here confirmthe necessityofcalibration checkson the validity of aerodynamic estimates of the turbulent fluxes.},

  abstract = {Fluid chemistry in the vadose zone absent of organic life is governed by the interactions between rock mineral surfaces, water and atmospheric carbon dioxide [CO2] since carbon and its aquatic species control the system pH. Even though the effects of high carbon concentrations in the pore fluids of rocks and soils can be controlled ex-situ, their non-invasive monitoring and control still face difficulty, due to the inaccessibility of pore spaces. We propose monitoring the effect of carbon-rich solutions via their influence on the electrical relaxation behaviour, using the spectral induced polarization (SIP) method. Generally, the SIP response is determined by the rock's texture and the chemical composition of the electrical double layer (EDL) forming at the mineral--water interface. The understanding of how the relaxation behaviour of rocks and soils is controlled by pore water salinity and pH and how fast the EDL adapts to changes in pore fluid chemistry, however, is still limited. In this study, we conducted a series of controlled experiments where the diffusion of sodium hydrogencarbonate solution into quartzrich sandstones was monitored with SIP at high temporal resolution. To identify the underlying relaxation processes, we analysed the obtained complex conductivity spectra by performing a Debye decomposition, yielding the system's relaxation-time distribution. Our results show that increasing pH leads to increased imaginary conductivities and systematic shifts in the peak relaxation time of the system. The observed temporal dynamics of the peak relaxation time can be described with a diffusion-type equation. We find that the dynamics are not governed by the permeability or porosity of the rock. In one experiment, salinities high enough to diminish the polarization of the system were reached. This reduction in polarization at peak frequency cannot be explained through simple Stern layer polarization models alone, suggesting that diffusive layer polarization plays an important role with increasing pH. While polarization magnitude reduces significantly, peak spectral position shifts towards larger relaxation times suggesting a reduction in the mobilities of the surface ions. Due to the increased salinity, the double layer thickness decreases, in turn decreasing the relaxation length scale, and lowering the diffuse layers screening effect. This study shows that the SIP method can capture the dynamic changes at the mineral--water interfaces in rocks in response to changing pH over a broad range of salinities, making SIP a promising method for the monitoring of subsurface processes associated with changes in the inorganic carbon concentration of the pore fluid.},

  abstract = {Efficient noninvasive techniques are desired for monitoring the remediation process of contaminated soils. We applied the direct current resistivity technique to image conductivity changes in sandbox experiments where two sandy and clayey soils were initially contaminated with diesel hydrocarbon. The experiments were conducted over a 230 day period. The removal of hydrocarbon was enhanced by a bioelectrochemical system (BES) and the electrical potentials of the BES reactors were also monitored during the course of the experiment. We found that the variation in electrical conductivity shown in the tomograms correlate well with diesel removal from the sandy soil, but this is not the case with the clayey soil. The clayey soil is characterized by a larger specific surface area and therefore a larger surface conductivity. In sandy soil, the removal of the diesel and products from degradation leads to an increase in electrical conductivity during the first 69 days. This is expected since diesel is electrically insulating. For both soils, the activity of BES reactors is moderately imaged by the inverted conductivity tomogram of the reactor. An increase in current production by electrochemically active bacteria activity corresponds to an increase in conductivity of the reactor.},

  abstract = {The high copper (Cu) concentration in vineyard soils causes the increase of Cu toxicity symptoms in young grapevines. Recently, intercropping of grapevine and oat was shown to reduce Cu toxicity effects, modulating the root ionome. On these bases, the focus of the work was to investigate the impact of Cu toxicity of either monocropped or oat-intercropped grapevine rootstocks plants (196.17 and Fercal), at both phenotypic (i.e., root architecture), and molecular (i.e., expression of transporters) levels. The results showed a different response in terms of root morphology that are both rootstock- and cropping system dependent. Moreover, the expression pattern of transporter genes (i.e., VvCTr, VvNRAMP, and VvIRT1) in monocropped grapevine might resemble a Mn deficiency response induced by the excess of Cu, especially in Fercal plants. The gene expression in intercropped grapevines suggested rootstock-specific response mechanisms, depending on Cu levels. In fact, at low Cu concentrations, Fercal enhanced both root system growth and transporter genes expression; contrarily, 196.17 increased apoplast divalent cations accumulation and transporters expression. At high Cu concentrations, Fercal increased the expression of all bivalent cation transporters and, as previously observed, enhanced the release of root exudates, whereas the 196.17 only modulated transporters. In conclusion, our results might suggest that the different adaptation strategies of the two rootstocks to Cu toxicity could be mainly ascribable to a fine-tuning of bivalent cations transporters expression at root level.},

Research on organic light-emitting diodes, organic photovoltaics, and organic thin-film transistors is already in an advanced stage, and the derived devices are commercially available. A more recent case is the organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), whose core component is a conductive polymer in contact with ions and solvent molecules of an electrolyte, thus allowing it to simultaneously regulate electron and ion transport. OECTs are very effective in ion-to-electron transduction and sensor signal amplification. The use of synthetically tunable, biocompatible, and depositable organic materials in OECTs makes them specially interesting for biological applications and printable devices. In this review, we provide an overview of the history of OECTs, their physical characterization, and their operation mechanism. We analyze OECT performance improvements obtained by geometry design and active material selection (i.e., conductive polymers and small molecules) and conclude with their broad range of applications from biological sensors to wearable devices.},

  abstract = {Induced polarization (IP) is an acknowledged method in ore exploration and can be applied to evaluate the metal content in dumps containing the residues of ore processing facilities. Existing models explain the relationships between ore content and grain size of the ore particles with IP parameters. However, the models assume full water saturation of the ore containing samples, which is often not the case in field conditions at dump sites. Hence, our study investigates the effect of desaturation on the resulting IP signal. We used six different sand--pyrite mixtures with varying amount and grain sizes of the pyrite particles. Evaporative drying desaturated the samples. Complex conductivity spectra were recorded in the frequency range between 0.02 and 1000 Hz at certain saturation levels. The resulting spectra indicate an decrease of the conductivity amplitude with progressing desaturation. This effect agrees with the second empirical Archie equation. The saturation exponent of the conductivity amplitude shows values slightly larger than one. The measured spectra were processed by a Debye decomposition. We observe a nearly constant total chargeability during desaturation. This finding is in agreement with existing models that relate the total chargeability to the metal content in the sample. However, the mean relaxation time decreases remarkably during the drying process, whereas the normalized relaxation time, which considers the ratio between the mean relaxation time and the resistivity of the embedding material, does not indicate any dependence on water saturation. This behaviour contradicts existing models that predict a decreasing relaxation time with increasing water salinity, which results from evaporative drying. In order to explain the observed effects, we propose a conceptional model that compares a mixture of pyrite particles in an embedding material (sand, water and air) with an electrical RC circuit. The pyrite grains behave as small condensers that are charged and discharged via the conductive background material. According to this simple physical model, the relaxation time is proportional to the resistivity of the embedding material. A resistivity increase while desaturation causes an increase of relaxation time as observed in our experiments. This conceptional model is in good agreement with other experiments that change the resistivity in the background material by varying water salinity or clay content. The capacitive behaviour of the dispersed particles is characterized by the normalized relaxation time that depends on the grain size and the volume content of the pyrite particles.},

IP spectra measured over a wide frequency range can be used to characterize material properties of ores, slags and other residual material from mines and processing facilities. Previous studies have shown that IP parameters are sensitive to type, content or grain size of electronically conductive or semiconductive minerals. Up to now, a variety of experiments has been performed on sand mixtures with fractions of ore minerals. Most experiments consider only a single fraction with a fixed grain size. We continue a series of experiments that have been done with sand--pyrite mixtures. The presented study compares IP spectra recorded for samples either with a single grain radius fraction (E-samples) or with two different grain radii fractions (Z-samples). The spectra are fitted to Pelton models. A Debye decomposition that provides a relaxation time distribution (RTD) is applied to the complex conductivity spectra. The RTD indicates separated maxima only if the ratio of mean grain radii is larger than a factor five. The resolution of the phase spectra and the spectra of imaginary part of conductivity is lower. Even though the volumetric pyrite content is equal in each fraction, the phase spectra and RTD of the Z-samples indicate much higher signals for the pyrite fraction with smaller grain radius. The same observation is made for the chargeability that shows larger values for decreasing grain radii. This finding contradicts existing theories that consider the chargeability as a suitable proxy of the volumetric content of ore minerals. We explain the observed effect by an interaction between neighbouring pyrite particles. The conductivity of the mixtures of the E-samples increases with decreasing grain radius of the pyrite fraction. This effect is attributed to dissolution effects on the surface of the pyrite particles during the sample preparation. We find that the additive superposition of the phase spectra of two E-samples is in good agreement with the measured phase spectra of the Z-samples (measured superposition) containing the two corresponding pyrite fractions. The agreement is slightly worse for the spectra of imaginary part of conductivity, where the measured superposition overestimates the mathematical superposition. The experimental results of our study motivate a further improvement of existing mechanistic models.},

  abstract = {The investigation of plant roots is inherently difficult and often neglected. Being out of sight, roots are often out of mind. Nevertheless, roots play a key role in the exchange of mass and energy between soil and the atmosphere, in addition to the many practical applications in agriculture. In this paper, we propose a method for roots imaging based on the joint use of two electrical noninvasive methods: electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and mise-{\`a}-la-masse (MALM). The approach is based on the key assumption that the plant root system acts as an electrically conductive body, so that injecting electrical current into the plant stem will ultimately result in the injection of current into the subsoil through the root system, and particularly through the root terminations via hair roots. Evidence from field data, showing that voltage distribution is very different whether current is injected into the tree stem or in the ground, strongly supports this hypothesis. The proposed procedure involves a stepwise inversion of both ERT and MALM data that ultimately leads to the identification of electrical resistivity (ER) distribution and of the current injection root distribution in the threedimensional soil space. This, in turn, is a proxy to the active (hair) root density in the ground. We tested the proposed procedure on synthetic data and, more importantly, on field data collected in a vineyard, where the estimated depth of the root zone proved to be in agreement with literature on similar crops. The proposed noninvasive approach is a step forward towards a better quantification of root structure and functioning.},

  abstract = {Abstract. This paper presents a time-lapse application of electrical methods (electrical resistivity tomography, ERT; and mise-{\`a}-la-masse, MALM) for monitoring plant roots and their activity (root water uptake) during a controlled infiltration experiment. The use of non-invasive geophysical monitoring is of increasing interest as these techniques provide time-lapse imaging of processes that otherwise can only be measured at few specific spatial locations. The experiment here described was conducted in a vineyard in Bordeaux (France) and was focused on the behaviour of two neighbouring grapevines. The joint application of ERT and MALM has several advantages. While ERT in time-lapse mode is sensitive to changes in soil electrical resistivity and thus to the factors controlling it (mainly soil water content, in this context), MALM uses DC current injected into a tree stem to image where the plant root system is in effective electrical contact with the soil at locations that are likely to be the same where root water uptake (RWU) takes place. Thus, ERT and MALM provide complementary information about the root structure and activity. The experiment shows that the region of likely electrical current sources produced by MALM does not change significantly during the infiltration time in spite of the strong changes of electrical resistivity caused by changes in soil water content. Ultimately, the interpretation of the current source distribution strengthened the hypothesis of using current as a proxy for root detection. This fact, together with the evidence that current injection in the soil and in the stem produces totally different voltage patterns, corroborates the idea that this application of MALM highlights the active root density in the soil. When considering the electrical resistivity changes (as measured by ERT) inside the stationary volume of active roots delineated by MALM, the overall tendency is towards a resistivity increase during irrigation time, which can be linked to a decrease in soil water content caused by root water uptake. On the contrary, when considering the soil volume outside the MALM-derived root water uptake region, the electrical resistivity tends to decrease as an effect of soil water content increase caused by the infiltration. The use of a simplified infiltration model confirms at least qualitatively this behaviour. The monitoring results are particularly promising, and the method can be applied to a variety of scales including the laboratory scale where direct evidence of root structure and root water uptake can help corroborate the approach. Once fully validated, the joint use of MALM and ERT can be used as a valuable tool to study the activity of roots under a wide variety of field conditions.},

In this paper, we discuss the choices to be made to combine root-zone hydrology and geoelectrical data with the aim of characterizing the active root zone. For each model and observation type we discuss sources of uncertainty and how they are commonly addressed in a stochastic inversion framework. We point out different degrees of integration in the existing hydrogeophysical approaches to parametrize models of root-zone hydrology. This paper aims at giving emphasis to stochastic approaches, in particular to Data Assimilation (DA) schemes, that are generally identified as the best way to combine geoelectrical data with Root Water Uptake (RWU) models. In addition, the study points out a more suitable objective function taken from the optimal transport theory that better captures complex geometry of root systems. Another pathway for improvement of geoelectrical data integration into RWU models using DA relies on the use of stem based methods as a leverage to introduce more extensive root knowledge into RWU macroscopic hydrological models.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Traditionally interpretation of Mise-{\`a}-la-masse (MALM) is limited to the visualization of equipotential contours in order to infer qualitatively the extent of the anomaly. MALM inversion algorithms rely on having a good knowledge of the electrical resistivity distribution in the subsoil. Conversely, potential imaging methods have shown their strength for several applications to quickly estimate the depth of sources even in highly heterogeneous media. In the case of the MALM method, the physics may be described by Poisson's equation. As the conductivity term is modulating the flux of current, MALM is generally referred to as a pseudo-potential method. In this work, we have tested, for the first time, the application of the potential field theory to MALM in order to identify the current source depth. Synthetic modeling shows that the proposed algorithm is effective and efficient, using surface voltage measurements for different resistivity contrasts, anomaly depths and noise levels. We then applied the method to the real field case of a landfill leakage and showed how very different source depth estimates result from an intact or a damaged landfill liner.           ,              Plain Language Summary             The so-called Mise-{\`a}-la-Masse (MALM) technique is a well-known active geoelectrical prospection method aimed at imaging (qualitatively) electrically conductive (often ore) bodies in the subsurface. The current is injected in the core of the body to prospect, and the high electrical conductivity of the body channels the current making it detectable from the anomalies of electrical potential measured, for example, at the ground surface. Verification of landfill liner integrity is one of the most recent applications of MALM, exploiting the electrical and hydraulic separation, often made with a plastic liner, between the conductive waste inside and the soil outside. Holes in the liner may be imaged inducing a passage of direct current (DC) between the inner and the outer part of the landfill, provided that the location of such holes be identified using an efficient MALM inversion. For this purpose, we adapted an algorithm used for voltage inversion to MALM: the approach has proven effective using synthetic modeling and was successfully applied to real field data from an industrial landfill.           ,              Key Points                                                                We have developed the potential field imaging theory to estimate the depth of current sources in Mise-{\`a}-la-masse surveys                                                     Synthetic and field applications of a landfill leakage is demonstrated                                                     An Open-source code for inversion of voltage using potential field imaging theory is provided},

The implementation of water-saving irrigation strategies, such as the partial root zone drying (PRD) method, is part of a comprehensive approach to enhance water use efficiency. To reach this goal tools are needed for the evaluation of the root's and soil water dynamics in time and space. In controlled laboratory conditions, using a rhizotron built for geoelectrical tomography imaging, we monitored the spatio-temporal changes in soil electrical resistivity (ER) for more than a month corresponding to eight alternating water inputs cycles. Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) was complemented with electrical current imaging (ECI) using plant-stem-induced electrical stimulation. To estimate soil water content in the rhizotron during the experiment, we incorporated Archie's law as a constitutive model. We demonstrated that under mild water stress conditions, it is practically impossible to spatially distinguish the limited-water-availability effects using ECI. We evidenced that the current source density spatial distribution varied during the course of the experiment with the transpiration demand but without any significant relationship to the soil water content changes. On the other hand, ERT showed spatial patterns associated with irrigation and, to a lesser degree, to RWU (root water uptake) and hydraulic redistribution. The interpretation of the geoelectrical imaging with respect to root activity was strengthened and correlated with indirect observations of the plant transpiration using a weight monitoring lysimeter and direct observation of the plant leaf gas exchanges.},

They are often selectively permeable to ions such as sodium, potassium or calcium. Rapid signalling in neurons requires fast voltage sensitive mechanisms for closing and opening the pore. Anything that interferes with the membrane voltage can alter channel gating and comparatively small changes in the gating properties of a channel can have profound effects. Extremely low frequency electrical or magnetic fields are thought to produce, at most, microvolt changes in neuronal membrane potential. At first sight, such changes in membrane potential seem orders of magnitude too small to significantly influence neuronal signalling. However, in the central nervous system, a number of mechanisms exist which amplify signals. This may allow such small changes in membrane potential to induce significant physiological effects.},

However, a multitude of studies from around the world indicate that the turbulent heat fluxes are generally underestimated using eddy-covariance measurements, and hence, the energy balance is not closed. This energy-balance-closure problem, which has been heavily covered in the literature for more than 25 years, is the topic of the present review, in which we provide an overview of the potential reason for the lack of closure. We demonstrate the effects of the diurnal cycle on the energy balance closure, and address questions with regard to the partitioning of the energy balance residual between the sensible and the latent fluxes, and whether the magnitude of the flux underestimation can be predicted based on other variables typically measured at micrometeorological stations. Remaining open questions are discussed and potential avenues for future research on this topic are laid out. Integrated studies, combining multi-tower experiments and scale-crossing, spatially-resolving lidar and airborne measurements with high-resolution large-eddy simulations, are considered to be of critical importance for enhancing our understanding of the underlying transport processes in the atmospheric boundary layer.},

The subsurface region proximal to SW bodies, the GW--SW interface, is crucial as it actively regulates the transfer of nutrients, contaminants, and water between GW systems and SW environments. However, geological, hydrological, and biogeochemical heterogeneity in the GW--SW interface makes it difficult to characterise with direct observations. Over the past two decades geophysics has been increasingly used to characterise spatial and temporal variability throughout the GW--SW interface. Geophysics is a powerful tool in evaluating structural heterogeneity, revealing zones of GW discharge, and monitoring hydrological processes. Geophysics should be used alongside traditional hydrological and biogeochemical methods to provide additional information about the subsurface. Further integration of commonly used geophysical techniques, and adoption of emerging techniques, has the potential to improve understanding of the properties and processes of the GW--SW interface, and ultimately the implications for water quality and environmental health.},

  abstract = {Frequency domain electromagnetic induction (EMI) methods have had a long history of qualitative mapping for environmental applications. More recently, the development of multi-coil and multi-frequency instruments is such that the focus has shifted toward inverting data to obtain quantitative models of electrical conductivity. However, whilst the collection of EMI data is relatively straightforward, inverse modeling is more complicated. Furthermore, although several com\- mercial and open-source inversion codes exist, there is still a need for user-friendly software that can bring EMI inversion to a non-specialist audience. Here the opensource EMagPy software is presented as an intuitive approach to modeling EMI data. It comprises a graphical user interface (GUI) and a Python application pro\- gramming interface (API) that is more suitable for specialized tasks. EMagPy implements both cumulative sensitivity and Maxwell-based forward operators and can model data for 1D and quasi-2D/3D cases using either deterministic or probabilistic methods. The EMagPy GUI has a logical `tab-based' layout to lead the user through data importing, data filtering, inversion, and plotting of raw and inverted data. Additionally, a dedicated forward modeling tab is presented that allows the generation of synthetic data. In this publication, necessary considerations, and background, of EMI theory are described before EMagPy's capabilities are presented through a series of synthetic and field-based case studies. Firstly, the performance of cumulative sensitivity and Maxwell-based forward models, and the influence of measurement noise are assessed for synthetic cases. Then the importance of data calibration for a riparian wetland dataset, the ability to include a priori information for a river-borne survey, and the potential for monitoring soil moisture in a time-lapse example are all investigated. It is anticipated that EMagPy offers a user-friendly tool suitable for novice and experienced practitioners alike, and its intuitive nature means it can provide a useful tool for teaching purposes.},

  abstract = {Hydrologic data are at the core of our understanding of physical hydrologic processes, our simulation models and forecasts of water resources and hazards, and our monitoring of water quantity and quality. However, hydrologic data are subject to multiple sources of uncertainty that can introduce bias and error into our analyses and decision-making if not properly accounted for. In this article, we summarize five categories of data uncertainty: measurement uncertainty, derived data uncertainty, interpolation uncertainty, scaling uncertainty, and data management uncertainty. Hydrologic data uncertainty magnitudes are typically in the range 10--40\%. To quantify data uncertainty, hydrologists should first construct a perceptual model of uncertainty that itemizes uncertainty sources. The magnitude of each source can then be estimated using replicates (repeated, nested or subsampled measurements), or information from the literature (in-depth uncertainty results from experimental catchments, colocated gauges or method comparisons). Multiple uncertainty sources can be combined using Monte Carlo methods to determine total uncertainty. Data uncertainty analysis improves hydrologic process understanding by enabling robust hypothesis testing and identification of spatial and temporal patterns that relate to true process differences rather than data uncertainty. By quantifying uncertainty in data used for input or evaluation of hydrologic models, we can prevent parameter bias, exclude disinformative data, and enhance model performance evaluation. In water management applications, quantifying data uncertainty can lead to robust risk analysis, reduced costs, and transparent results that improve the trust of the public and water managers.

Within this highly dynamic soil environment roots must sense, interact with, and acclimate to factors such as water availability, microbiota, and heterogeneous distribution of nutrients. To aid their acclimation, roots alter their growth and development to optimize their architecture and actively regulate the physical, chemical, and biological properties of their rhizosphere. Understanding the complex interactions between roots and rhizosphere is critical for designing future crops with improved root traits better adapted to diverse and challenging soil conditions. However, studying roots and their interactions with soil under real-world conditions presents significant challenges. Addressing these challenges demands developing realistic laboratory-based model systems and innovative field-based root imaging techniques. Our review surveys the current knowledge and recent advances in understanding root--environment interactions while proposing future solutions to study roots under more ``real-life'' soil conditions.},

  abstract = {Geophysical techniques, such as spectral induced polarization (SIP), offer potentially powerful approaches for in situ monitoring of subsurface biogeochemistry. The successful implementation of these techniques as monitoring tools for reactive transport phenomena, however, requires the deconvolution of multiple contributions to measured signals. Here, we present SIP spectra and complementary biogeochemical data obtained in saturated columns packed with alternating layers of ferrihydrite-coated and pure quartz sand, and inoculated with Shewanella oneidensis supplemented with lactate and nitrate. A biomass-explicit diffusion-reaction model is fitted to the experimental biogeochemical data. Overall, the results highlight that (1) the temporal response of the measured imaginary conductivity peaks parallels the microbial growth and decay dynamics in the columns, and (2) SIP is sensitive to changes in microbial abundance and cell surface charging properties, even at relatively low cell densities ({$<$}108 cells mL-1). Relaxation times ({$\tau$}) derived using the Cole-Cole model vary with the dominant electron accepting process, nitrate or ferric iron reduction. The observed range of {$\tau$} values, 0.012-0.107 s, yields effective polarization diameters in the range 1-3 {$\mu$}m, that is, 2 orders of magnitude smaller than the smallest quartz grains in the columns, suggesting that polarization of the bacterial cells controls the observed chargeability and relaxation dynamics in the experiments.},

  abstract = {Background Root systems are key contributors to plant health, resilience, and, ultimately, yield of agricultural crops. To optimize plant performance, phenotyping trials are conducted to breed plants with diverse root traits. However, traditional analysis methods are often labour-intensive and invasive to the root system, therefore limiting highthroughput phenotyping. Spectral electrical impedance tomography (sEIT) could help as a non-invasive and cost-efficient alternative to optical root analysis, potentially providing 2D or 3D spatio-temporal information on root development and activity. Although impedance measurements have been shown to be sensitive to root biomass, nutrient status, and diurnal activity, only few attempts have been made to employ tomographic algorithms to recover spatially resolved information on root systems. In this study, we aim to establish relationships between tomographic electrical polarization signatures and root traits of different fine root systems (maize, pinto bean, black bean, and soy bean) under hydroponic conditions. Results Our results show that, with the use of an optimized data acquisition scheme, sEIT is capable of providing spatially resolved information on root biomass and root surface area for all investigated root systems. We found strong correlations between the total polarization strength and the root biomass (R2 = 0.82) and root surface area (R2 = 0.8). Our findings suggest that the captured polarization signature is dominated by cell-scale polarization processes. Additionally, we demonstrate that the resolution characteristics of the measurement scheme can have a significant impact on the tomographic reconstruction of root traits. Conclusion Our findings showcase that sEIT is a promising tool for the tomographic reconstruction of root traits in high-throughput root phenotyping trials and should be evaluated as a substitute for traditional, often time-consuming, root characterization methods.},

  abstract = {A nondestructive and spatially integrated multielectrode method for measuring soil electrical resistivity was tested in the Beauce region of France during a period of corn crop irrigation to monitor soil water flow over time and in two-dimensional (2-D) with simultaneous measurements of soil moisture and thermal profiles. The results suggested the potential of surface electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) for improving soil science and agronomy studies. The method was able to produce a 2-D delimitation of soil horizons as well as to monitor soil water movement. Soil drainage through water uptake by the roots, the progression of the infiltration front with preferential flow zones, and the drainage of the plowed horizon were well identified. At the studied stage of corn development (3 months) the soil zones where infiltration and drainage occurred were mainly located under the corn rows. The structural soil characteristics resulting from agricultural practices or the passage of agricultural equipment were also shown. Two-dimensional sections of soil moisture content were calculated using ERT. The estimates were made by using independently established ``in situ'' calibration relationships between the moisture and electrical resistivity of typical soil horizons. The thermal soil profile was also considered in the modeling. The results showed a reliable linear relationship between the calculated and measured water contents in the crop horizon. The precision of the calculation of the specific soil water content, quantified by the root mean square error (RMSE), was 3.63\% with a bias corresponding to an overestimation of 1.45\%. The analysis and monitoring of the spatial variability of the soil moisture content with ERT represent two components of a significant tool for better management of soil water reserves and rational irrigation practices.},

  abstract = {Time-lapse electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) has many practical applications to the study of subsurface properties and processes. When inverting time-lapse ERT data, it is useful to proceed beyond straightforward inversion of data differences and take advantage of the time-lapse nature of the data. We assess various approaches for inverting and interpreting time-lapse ERT data and determine that two approaches work well. The first approach is model subtraction after separate inversion of the data from two time periods, and the second approach is to use the inverted model from a base data set as the reference model or prior information for subsequent time periods. We prefer this second approach. Data inversion methodology should be consideredwhen designing data acquisition; i.e., to utilize the second approach, it is important to collect one or more data sets for which the bulk of the subsurface is in a background or relatively unperturbed state. A third and commonly used approach to time-lapse inversion, inverting the difference between two data sets, localizes the regions of the model in which change has occurred; however, varying noise levels between the two data sets can be problematic. To further assess the various time-lapse inversion approaches, we acquired field data from a catchment within the Dry Creek Experimental Watershed near Boise, Idaho, U.S.A. We combined the complimentary information from individual static ERT inversions, time-lapse ERT images, and available hydrologic data in a robust interpretation scheme to aid in quantifying seasonal variations in subsurface moisture content.},

  abstract = {Electrical resistivity of soil has become one of the most important indicators of compactness and compressive resistance. In previous studies, the temperature of soil tested was always above 0 {$^\circ$}C. However, due to the phase change of pore water, the resistivity of freezing soils is different from that of unfrozen soils. Therefore, it is necessary to clarify the influence of temperature on electrical resistivity. To achieve this goal, according to the bundle of the cylindrical capillary model, pores in soil were treated as conducting tubes, and two simple lognormal functions were introduced to describe the distribution of the conducting tubes. Based on the conductivity theory, a new model considering the temperature and the pore size distribution was presented. Results show that only a part of the conducting tubes can be treated as the effective conducting tubes, which are determined by the soil temperature. Furthermore, a small portion of the pores with the smaller size controlled the electrical resistivity of the freezing clay. In other words, the change in the electrical resistivity of freezing clay was caused mainly by the change of unfrozen water content through the decrease in temperature. Based on the experimental results conducted on clay from Northeast China, the validity of the presented model was verified. The comparison results indicate that there was a good agreement between the calculated results and the experimental results. To expand the scope of the model, more laboratory tests are suggested to conduct to verify the applicability of the model to other clays.},

  abstract = {Citrus latifolia is increasingly being cultivated in Mediterranean areas, where the need for precise irrigation implies a sound knowledge of the crop's water requirements, which is carried out by monitoring the tree water status in the plant-soil-atmosphere system. Two year-old lime trees (Citrus latifolia Tan. cv. Bearss) were cultivated in 45 L weighing pot-lysimeters filled with a clay-loam soil and equipped with soil water sensors for recording the real-time soil water status. Irrigation, drainage, pot weight, and agro-meteorological variables were also recorded in real-time. Plant water relations - stem ({$\Psi$}stem) and leaf ({$\Psi$}leaf) water potentials, and leaf gas exchange - were periodically measured throughout the experiment. The automated irrigation protocol based on the volumetric soil water content was set to prevent tree water stress (with mean seasonal values of {$\Psi$}stem above -0.8 MPa and 7 {$\mu$}mol m 2 s 1 and 80 mmol m 2 s 1, for net phtosynthesis and stomatal conductance, respectively). From the soil water pot balance, the computed fortnightly ET mean values throughout the growing season varied from 0.25 to 2.56 L plant 1 day 1 in winter and summer months, respectively. Maximum ET values occurred in July when evaporative demand was highest and lime fruits were in their most active growing phase. For day length, lime tree biomass changes were negligible, and the pot tree weight variations served for ET water balance validation (r2=0.92***). The contribution of this work is that it establishes a scalable weighing lysimeter prototype for determining the ET of lime trees grown in Mediterranean semi-arid conditions, using real-time soil water balance monitoring managed by an irrigation automation protocol. This approach could be replicated for precise ET measurements in other crops.},

  abstract = {Abstract             For surface fluxes of carbon dioxide, the net daily flux is the sum of daytime and nighttime fluxes of approximately the same magnitude and opposite direction. The net flux is therefore significantly smaller than the individual flux measurements and error assessment is critical in determining whether a surface is a net source or sink of carbon dioxide. For carbon dioxide flux measurements, it is an occasional misconception that the net flux is measured as the difference between the net upward and downward fluxes (i.e. a small difference between large terms). This is not the case. The net flux is the sum of individual (half-hourly or hourly) flux measurements, each with an associated error term. The question of errors and uncertainties in long-term flux measurements of carbon and water is addressed by first considering the potential for errors in flux measuring systems in general and thus errors which are relevant to a wide range of timescales of measurement. We also focus exclusively on flux measurements made by the micrometeorological method of eddy covariance. Errors can loosely be divided into random errors and systematic errors, although in reality any particular error may be a combination of both types. Systematic errors can be fully systematic errors (errors that apply on all of the daily cycle) or selectively systematic errors (errors that apply to only part of the daily cycle), which have very different effects. Random errors may also be full or selective, but these do not differ substantially in their properties. We describe an error analysis in which these three different types of error are applied to a long-term dataset to discover how errors may propagate through long-term data and which can be used to estimate the range of uncertainty in the reported sink strength of the particular ecosystem studied.},

The test was aimed at identifying the system's hydraulic properties. Some of the expected limitations of the method --- particularly caused by the strong decrease in ERT resolution with depth --- and the consequent problems with mass balance and moment calculation could be partly balanced by the use of direct measurements of groundwater electrical conductivity and tracer concentration at one selected location. The vast heterogeneity of the system, ranging in lithology from clay to gravel at a scale of meters to tens of meters, reflects itself in the tracer migration and distribution over time: The tracer is trapped in the low-permeability regions and from these it is slowly released over time. Highresolution surface ERT proves effective at picturing this system behavior over time. The extreme heterogeneity is also a challenge in the attempt to translate bulk electrical conductivity into estimates of groundwater electrical conductivity and, hence, solute concentration because surface conductivity in fine sediments has an important role. The test results could be used to identify some of the key parameters for solute transport, namely, mean groundwater velocity and aquifer dispersivity at the scale of the test by means of transport model calibration.},

Cosmic Ray Neutron Probes (CRNP) could be an option to fill the scale gap between both systems, as they provide area-average soil moisture within a 150--250 m radius footprint. In this study, we evaluate differences and similarities between CRNP observations, and surface soil moisture products from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2), the METOP-A/B Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT), the Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP), the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS), as well as simulations from the Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS2). Six CRNPs located on five continents have been selected as test sites: the Rur catchment in Germany, the COSMOS sites in Arizona and California (USA), and Kenya, one CosmOz site in New South Wales (Australia), and a site in Karnataka (India). Standard validation scores as well as the Triple Collocation (TC) method identified SMAP to provide a high accuracy soil moisture product with low noise or uncertainties as compared to CRNPs. The potential of CRNPs for satellite soil moisture validation has been proven; however, biomass correction methods should be implemented to improve its application in regions with large vegetation dynamics.},

The objective of this study was to develop relationships defining citrus fibrous root length density (FRLD) as a function of soil depth, distance from the tree trunk, and tree size. Root systems of 18 trees with tree canopy volumes (TCV) ranging from 2.4 to 34.3 m3 on two different rootstocks and growing in well-drained sandy soils were sampled in a systematic pattern extending 2 m away from the trunk and 0.9 m deep. Trees grown on Swingle citrumelo [Citrus paradisi Macf. {$\cdot$} Poncirus trjfoliata (L.) Raf.] rootstock had significantly greater FRLD in the top 0.15 m than trees on Carrizo citrange (C. sinensis {$\cdot$} P. trifoliata). Conversely, Carrizo citrange had greater FRLD from 0.15 to 0.75 m below the soil surface. FRLD was significantly greater for `Hamlin' orange trees grown on Swingle citrumelo rootstock at distances less than 0.75 m from the tree trunk compared with those on Carrizo citrange. Fibrous roots of young citrus trees developed a dense root mat above soil depths of 0.3 m that expanded both radially and with depth with time as trees grow and TCV increased. Functional relationships developed in this study accounted for changes in FRLD with increase in tree size.},

  abstract = {The impact of climate change on the agricultural systems of three major islands in the Mediterranean basin, namely Sicily, Crete and Cyprus, was evaluated using a suite of specifically calibrated crop models and the outputs of a regional circulation model for Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 downscaled to 12 km of resolution and tested for its effectiveness in reproducing the local meteorological data. The most important annual (wheat, barley, tomato and potato) and perennial (grapevine and olive tree) crops were selected to represent the agricultural systems of the islands. The same modelling framework was used to test the effectiveness of autonomous adaptation options, such as shifting sowing date and the use of varieties with different growing season length. The results highlighted that, on average, warmer temperatures advanced both anthesis and maturity of the selected crops, but at different magnitudes depending on the crop and the island. Winter crops (barley, wheat and potato) experienced the lowest impact in terms of yield loss with respect to the baseline, with even some positive effects, especially in Sicily where both wheat and barley showed a general increase of 9\% as compared to the baseline, while potato increased up to + 17\%. Amongst perennial crops, olive tree showed low variation under RCP 4.5, but on average increased by 7\% under RCP 8.5 on the three islands. Climate change had a detrimental effect specifically on tomato (- 2\% on average in RCP 8.5 and 4.5 on the three islands) and grapevine (- 7\%). The use of different sowing dates, or different varieties, revealed that for winter crops early autumn sowing is still the best option for producing wheat and barley in future periods on the three islands under both future scenarios. For tomato and potato, advancing sowing date to early winter is a winning strategy that may even increase final yield (+ 9\% for tomato and + 17\% for potato, on average). For grapevine, the use of late varieties, while suffering the most from increasing temperatures and reduced rainfall (- 15\%, on average), is still a valuable option to keep high yield levels with respect to earlier varieties, which even if showing some increases with respect to the baseline have a generally much lower production level. The same may be applied to olive tree although the production differences between late and early varieties are less evident and climate change exerts a favourable influence (+ 4 and + 3\% for early and late varieties, respectively).},

At the end of the experiment in 1994, observations showed that the permanent grass cover caused a considerable decrease in the number of vine roots in the interrow, mainly in the upper soil layers, but an increase close to the row. The amount of organic matter, nitrogen, exchangeable K2O, pH, and soil moisture at field capacity increased under permanent grass cover, while bulk density and the mechanical resistance of the soil decreased.},

It is similar to the Childs and Collis-George (1950) model but uses a modified assumption concerning the hydraulic conductivity of the pore sequence in order to take into account the effect of the larger pore section. A computational method is derived for the determination of the residual water content and for the extrapolation of the water content-capillary head curve as measured in a limited range. The proposed model is compared with the existing practical models of Averjanov (1950), Wyllie and Gardner (1958), and Millington and Quirk (1961) on the basis of the measured data of 45 soils. It seems that the new model is in better agreement with observations.},

Prior studies have primarily focused on students' capacity for multitasking and distraction when using laptops. The present research suggests that even when laptops are used solely to take notes, they may still be impairing learning because their use results in shallower processing. In three studies, we found that students who took notes on laptops performed worse on conceptual questions than students who took notes longhand. We show that whereas taking more notes can be beneficial, laptop note takers' tendency to transcribe lectures verbatim rather than processing information and reframing it in their own words is detrimental to learning.},

Recent comprehensive computations of resistivity and induced-polarization response functions over a three horizontally layered earth have revealed that negative induced-polarization effects can also occur whenever the geoelectric section is of K type ({$\rho$}               1               , {$<$} {$\rho$}               2               {$>$} {$\rho$}               3               ) or Q type ({$\rho$}               1               {$>$} {$\rho$}               2               {$>$} {$\rho$}               3               ).                          For such sections, the induced-polarization function of the first layer (as defined by Seigel) can be negative. As a result, if the first layer is polarizable the response from deeper layers can be severely masked solely as a function of the resistivity distribution, thus limiting the depth of detection of buried sources. It is shown that for an m-layered earth, negative induced-polarization functions can be expected for those layers lying above a K or Q type sequence in the resistivity section. Any application of induced-polarization surveys must thus be preceded by a thorough evaluation of the resistivity data. The same applies for the quantitative interpretation of IP data.},

  abstract = {HVSR, known as the Nakamura method, was developed to reduce the influence of Rayleigh waves for a spectrum HHSR to estimate the seismic response at the ground surface versus that at a reference bedrock site, and is not used to characterize a Rayleigh-wave spectrum. Although misunderstandings and confusion are caused by the similar shape of each HVSR, I reiterate here the Nakamura method differs from methods to determine the characteristics of Rayleigh waves, and the target frequency range is also different. The intended frequency range of the Nakamura method is around F 0, which is the resonance frequency of the multiply reflected SH waves in the surface layer. Of course, the frequency range can be extended if the impact of Rayleigh waves is less, as for earthquake signals. On the other hand, the intended frequency range of methods for characterizing Rayleigh waves is greater than F 0 and generally more than 2F 0. I am conscious the Nakamura method is only one of the tools to estimate the resonance frequency and the amplification factor at the site. Although this is an available tool to estimate roughly the amplification factor with dispersion inherently, and it is possible to pick out a ground with relatively high risk based on the result of estimation, this is absolutely one of the engineering tools. I think this is not considered a scientific tool for theoretical exploration or pursuit of truth. On the other hand, I would like to add a remark that it is possible from the characteristics of the Nakamura method to estimate not only the resonance frequency and amplification factor of a surface layer using HVSR at ground surface but also the resonance frequency and the amplification factor of both buildings and ground using HVSR at the top of a building.},

  abstract = {Spatially explicit near-surface soil moisture ({\texttheta}) patterns at high temporal resolution play a very important role in environmental modelling for improving risk assessment and for quantifying the effects of climatic seasonality and land use/land cover change on ecosystem services and functions in Mediterranean catchments. Remote sensing data from the European Copernicus mission are highly acknowledged to serve as fast, reliable, and available suppliers for the derivation of area wide, high grid-resolution information (20 m  20 m) on near-surface soil moisture patterns acquired at a regular temporal resolution (satellite overpass is every six days). To reliably map {\texttheta} from remote sensing radar (i.e., Sentinel-1) satellite products, robust calibration with gridded ground-data is needed and use of either sporadically measured or continuously monitored {\texttheta} is of crucial importance for validation procedures. This study integrates remote- and ground-based monitoring of local- to field-scale {\texttheta} in the Alento hydrological observatory situated in southern Italy. This Critical Zone Observatory was recently established in the Mediterranean Region and equipped with a multi-sensor network infrastructure. The final aim of this study is to develop site-specific calibration functions to relate spectral measurements to gridded topographic features to estimate near-surface soil moisture patterns. Estimation performance will be evaluated by comparing remote sensing-based (Sentinel-1) with ground-based soil moisture measured during satellite overpass. The soil moisture transfer relations will eventually support high temporal catchment-based hydrological modeling of groundwater and surface water fluxes under consideration of the climatic variability and in feedback with the vegetation.},

The spatial damage-sensing ability is evaluated using a framework that integrates the electrical resistance tomography (ERT)-based conductivity reconstruction algorithm with multiscale numerical homogenization with a view to enable microstructure-guided design of such selfsensing composites. The ERT-based framework uses experimentally measured boundary electrode voltages as input; assigns the effective conductivity of the composite (obtained from numerical homogenization) as initial estimate of the conductivity distribution and initiates the iterative process involving the well-posed forward model and the ill-posed inverse problem to obtain the conductivity map in the damaged configuration. The reconstructed damage maps, thus obtained, confirm sufficient spatial damage-sensing ability of mortars containing 30\% or greater amount of iron powder validating the applicability of such self-sensing composites towards spatial damage sensing for health monitoring of structures.},

It comprises arrays of total-field magnetometers and time-domain electromagnetic induction (EMI) sensors, associated navigation and data acquisition hardware, and a custom Data Analysis System. The MTADS has conducted eleven demonstrations and surveys over the past four years. The system has shown the ability to detect ordnance at its likely self-penetration depths with a probability of detection of 0.95 or better. The model-derived positions and depths of the detected ordnance items are generally well within the physical size of the targets, making remediation much quicker and less costly than with standard techniques. Data sets corresponding to many of the MTADS surveys are available to others in the field.},

  abstract = {Water plays a crucial role in the melting of Earth's mantle. Mantle magmatisms mostly occur at plate boundaries (including subduction zones and mid-ocean ridges) and in some intraplate regions with thermal anomaly. At oceanic subduction zones, water released by the subducted slab may induce melting of the overlying mantle wedge or even the slab itself, giving rise to arc magmatism, or may evolve into a supercritical fluid. The physicochemical conditions for the formation of slab melt and supercritical fluid are still under debate. At mid-ocean ridges and intraplate hot zones, water and CO2 cause melting of the upwelling mantle to occur at greater depths and in greater extents. Low degree melting of the mantle may occur at boundaries between Earth's internal spheres, including the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB), the upper mantletransition zone boundary, and the transition zone-lower mantle boundary, usually attributed to contrasting water storage capacity across the boundary. The origin for the stimulating effect of water on melting lies in that water as an incompatible component has a strong tendency to be enriched in the melt (i.e., with a mineral-melt partition coefficient much smaller than unity), thereby lowering the Gibbs free energy of the melt. The partitioning of water between melt and mantle minerals such as olivine, pyroxenes and garnet has been investigated extensively, but the effects of hydration on the density and transport properties of silicate melts require further assessments by experimental and computational approaches.},

We described the design details that includes ease of assembly, carriage and minimum soil alteration.

  abstract = {During 1902 to 1906 as a soil physicist at the USDA Bureau of Soils (BOS), Edgar Buckingham originated the concepts of matric potential, soil--water retention curves, specific water capacity, and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (               K               ) as a distinct property of a soil. He applied a formula equivalent to Darcy's law (though without specific mention of Darcy's work) to unsaturated flow. He also contributed significant research on quasi-empirical formulas for               K               as a function of water content, water flow in capillary crevices and in thin films, and scaling. Buckingham's work on gas flow in soils produced paradigms that are consistent with our current understanding. His work on evaporation elucidated the concept of self-mulching and produced sound and sometimes paradoxical generalizations concerning conditions that favor or retard evaporation. Largely overshadowing those achievements, however, is that he launched a theory, still accepted today, that could predict transient water content as a function of time and space. Recently discovered documents reveal some of the arguments Buckingham had with BOS officials, including the text of a two-paragraph conclusion of his famous 1907 report on soil water, and the official letter documenting rejection of that text. Strained interpersonal relations motivated the departure of Buckingham and other brilliant physicists (N.E. Dorsey, F.H. King, and Lyman Briggs) from the BOS during 1903 to 1906. Given that Buckingham and his BOS colleagues had been rapidly developing the means of quantifying unsaturated flow, these strained relations probably slowed the advancement of unsaturated flow theory.},

In this paper, we present the results from a methodology applied in a site contaminated with chlorinated solvents, for characterization of the contamination in order to plan the remediation and to follow-up the initial step of in-situ remediation in an efficient way. We utilized the results from three different methods; membrane interface probe for direct measurement of the contaminant concentrations; seismic refraction tomography for investigating the depth to the bedrock interface; and direct current resistivity and time-domain induced polarization tomography to acquire a high-resolution imaging of the electrical properties of the subsurface. The results indicate that our methodology is very promising in terms of site characterization, and furthermore, has great potential for real-time geophysical monitoring of contaminated sites in the future.},

After analytical equations for the effective conductance of each part of the pathway are developed, the influences of soil drying on the soil water potential and LKll are described during a 30 d period for a loamy sand in the field. The influences of soil drying on Lp for three desert succulents, Agave deserti, Ferocactus acanthodes, and Opuntiaficus-indica,are also described for a 30 d period. To quantify the effects of soil drying on the development of a root-soil air gap, diameters of 6-week-old roots of the three species were determined at constant water vapour potentials of --- 1-0 MPa and - 10 MPa as well as with the water vapour potential decreasing at the same rate as soil drying during a 30 d period. The shrinkage observed for roots initially 20mm in diameter averaged 19\% during the 30d period. The predominant limiting factor for water movement was Lr of the root for the first 7 d of soil drying, the root-soil air gap for the next 13 d, and LKll thereafter. Compared with the ease of water uptake from a wet soil, the decrease in conductances during soil drying, especially the decrease in LKil, caused the overall conductance to decrease by 3 x lO{\textasciicircum}-fold during the 30 d period for the three species considered, so relatively little water was lost to the dry soil. Such rectifier-like behaviour of water movement in the soil-root system resulted primarily from changes in L{\textasciicircum}n and, presumably, is a general phenomenon among plants, preventing water loss during drought but facilitating water uptake after rainfall.},

The superior resolution is due in part to the slower average velocity; the water table is at or albove the ground surface in the stream channel. Spectral analysis shows that there is a small increase in the amplitude of the higher frequencies in the stream portion of the profile, so that the improved resolution is real. The apparent increased depth of penetration is partly due to the increased time required for echoes to return at the slower velocity, but the larger twoway travel time does yield a greater depth of penetration.},

  abstract = {Desert succulents are renowned for their rapid recovery of shoot function after periods of drought as a result of shoot succulence, root--shoot interactions, and key root properties. Near the base of the shoot, the proximal (generally older) roots appear to play a major role in the rapid uptake and delivery of water, especially after a period of soil drying when the rest of the root system has a lower hydraulic conductance. In all of the cacti, agaves, and yuccas examined to date, hydraulic conductance for the proximal root zone is unexpectedly high. Substantial water uptake by older roots of cacti is associated with much higher axial (xylem) hydraulic conductance in proximal than in distal root regions. For agaves and yuccas, proximal roots have other anatomical and physiological traits that enhance water uptake near the shoot base. Despite suberization (waxiness) of external root tissues in the proximal region, internal cell layers appear more characteristic of young root regions with living cortical cells and a high proportion of unsuberized passage cells in the endodermis. Both features may be related to the existence of a contractile root zone possessed by all members of the Agavaceae surveyed to date. Passage cells in the endodermis and aquaporins (protein water channels) in the metabolically active cortex expedite radial water transport. The radial swelling that accompanies longitudinal root contraction may also help maintain rootto-soil contact that would otherwise be diminished in dry soil. Modifications that increase axial and radial hydraulic conductance in the proximal root region suggest that water uptake by older roots is critical to the success of desert succulents.},

  abstract = {Small-scale resistivity inhomogeneities can result from the local distribution of water and the water and nutrient uptake of plants. Measuring small-scale Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) in the field comes with a set of particularities, especially when including borehole electrodes for a better resolution with depth. We apply smallscale borehole-to-surface ERT over a palaeochannel. Combining surface ERT with detailed borehole-to-surface ERT profiles along the measurement line allows a delineation of finer layering within the coarser lithology. Our field setup includes a borehole electrode tool with 20 ring electrodes, electrically coupled to the ground via a conductive mud. Two main points are addressed in this publication: (1) In the field, we electrically coupled the borehole electrodes to the ground by filling the cavities around the tool with a soil mud, i.e., we need to account for the unknown conductive borehole filling in the inversion. If not incorporated, the mud has a considerable influence on the resistivities close to the borehole tool, but also on the region around the surface electrodes. Consequently, alongside with a 3D inversion scheme representing the electrodes with the Complete Electrode Model (CEM), we include the mud as a separate and uncoupled region. We model the geometry of the mud layer around the tool and do not allow an influence of this region on the rest of the model. (2) Due to the small electrode distances and the overall small-scale nature of the array, the depth of installation of the borehole electrode tool must be known accurately in the inversion model. However, it is not easy to measure the tool depth in the field with the required accuracy, due to small-scale surface roughness, e.g., from a weathered loose soil layer at the surface or from vegetation. We also investigate the influence of a tilted tool installation and optimise for the depth and installation angle of the borehole tool before inverting for resistivities. An accurate knowledge of the borehole electrode positions is crucial for a reliable and precise inversion result. The surface electrodes establish a coordinate system around the borehole tool on the surface, with an angle {$\varphi$} describing the direction around the tool in the top view. The sensitive plane (in-plane) is defined as the x-z plane cutting through {$\varphi$} = 0{\textopenbullet} and {$\varphi$} = 180{\textopenbullet}. A tilting of the tool from the vertical direction is described by a tilting angle {\texttheta}. A tilting of the borehole tool within the sensitive plane manifests in an increased misfit between data points on both sides of the tool, i.e., at {$\varphi$} = 0{\textopenbullet} and {$\varphi$} = 180{\textopenbullet}. We use this difference to optimise on the tool angle. The true depth of the borehole tool is found by searching for a minimum of the objective function, describing the goodness of the found model, while assuming different tool depths in each inversion. We see a minimum of the objective functionwhich can be attributed to the correct depth range, as shown by a synthetic study. Through our optimisations, we can determine a tilting of the tool, i.e., the angle {\texttheta}, with an accuracy of 2{\textopenbullet} to 3{\textopenbullet} and the tool depth with an accuracy of a few centimetres, depending partially on the subsurface resistivities, i.e., our optimisation works mainly in predominantly horizontally layered soils. A tilting in directions out of the sensitive plane (out-ofplane) can be projected onto the sensitive plane, since the out-of-plane tilt has a negligible influence on the data. After this optimisation, we can determine layer resistivities from our field data.},

The plate method is simple and precise, but several previous studies have demonstrated the potential for relatively large errors. Here we present the results of in situ tests of the plate method, and we describe some promising alternative methods. Summertime soil heat flux was measured with heat flux plates and with two alternative methods at each of three sites. In total, three alternative methods were used: a single probe gradient method, a three needle gradient method, and a self-calibrating plate method. The standard plate method underestimated the magnitude of the heat flux by 18 to 66\% depending on the site and type of plate. Agreement between the alternative methods was good with discrepancies ranging from 2 to 6\%. The plates underestimate flux apparently due to a combination of low plate thermal conductivity, thermal contact resistance, and latent heat transfer effects. The three needle gradient method for measuring heat flux performed well at all three sites, providing a good alternative to the standard plate method. The self-calibrating plate method performed well at the one site where it was tested and may also be a good alternative. Increased adoption of these methods should lead to more accurate soil heat flux and surface energy balance data.},

  abstract = {Electromagnetics has an important role to play in solving the next generation of geoscience problems. These problems are multidisciplinary, complex, and require collaboration. This is especially true at the base scientific level where the underlying physical equations need to be solved, and data, associated with physical experiments, need to be inverted. In this paper, we present arguments for adopting an open-source methodology for geophysics and provide some background about open-source software for electromagnetics. Immediate benefits are the reduced time required to carry out research, being able to collaborate, having reproducible results, and being able to disseminate results quickly. To illustrate the use of an open-source methodology in electromagnetics, we present two challenges. The first is to simulate data from a time domain airborne system over a conductive plate buried in a more resistive earth. The second is to jointly invert airborne TDEM and FDEM data with ground TDEM. SimPEG, Simulation and Parameter Estimation in Geophysics, (https://simpeg.xyz) is used for the open-source software. The figures in this paper can be reproduced by downloading the Jupyter Notebooks we provide with this paper (https://github.com/simpegresearch/oldenburg-2018-AEM). Access to the source code allows the researcher to explore the simulations and inversions by changing model and inversion parameters, plot fields and fluxes to gain further insight about the EM phenomena, and solve a new research problem by using open-source software as a base. By providing results in a manner that allows others to reproduce, further explore, and even extend them, we hope to demonstrate that an open-source paradigm has the potential to enable more rapid progress of the geophysics community as a whole.},

  abstract = {Introduction               The mapping of soil properties, such as soil texture, at the field scale is important Q6 in the context of national agricultural planning/policy and precision agriculture. Electromagnetic Induction (EMI) surveys are commonly used to measure soil apparent electrical conductivity and can provide valuable insights into such subsurface properties.                                         Methods               Multi-receiver or multi-frequency instruments provide a vertical distribution of apparent conductivity beneath the instrument, while the mobility of such instruments allows for spatial coverage. Clustering is the grouping together of similar multi-dimensional data, such as the processed EMI data over a field. A neural network clustering process, where the number of clusters can be objectively determined, results in a set of one-dimensional apparent electrical conductivity cluster centers, which are representative of the entire three-dimensional dataset. These cluster centers are used to guide inversions of apparent conductivity data to give an estimate of the true electrical conductivity distribution at a site.                                         Results and discussion               The method is applied to two sites and the results demonstrate a correlation between (true) electrical conductivity with soil texture (sampled prior to the EMI surveys) which is superior to correlations where no clustering is included. The method has the potential to be developed further, with the aim of improving the prediction of soil properties at cluster scale, such as texture, from EMI data. A particularly important conclusion from this initial study is that EMI data should be acquired prior to a focused soil sampling campaign to calibrate the electrical conductivity -- soil property correlations.},

However, at low frequencies, there is a variety of active chemical processes which involve the movement or transfer of electrical charge. Measurements of electrical properties at low frequencies (such as induced polarization) observe such movement of charge and thus monitor many geochemical processes at a distance. Examples in which this has been done include oxidationreduction of metallic minerals such as sulfides, cation exchange on clays, and a variety of clay-organic reactions relevant to problems in toxic waste disposal and petroleum exploration. By using both the frequency dependence and nonlinear character of the complex resistivity spectrum, these reactions may be distinguished from each other and from barren or reactionless materials.},

  abstract = {The contamination by chlordecone (CLD) of soils and water in the French Caribbean (FC) has major environmental and human health impacts. In Situ Chemical Reduction (ISCR) is a promising method to degrade CLD but it generates transformation products (TPs). Here, the fate and transport of CLD and its TPs have been studied using three lysimeters, 65--70 cm-long and 20 cm in diameter, collected from a CLD contaminated nitisol in the FC. A simulated ISCR remediation process (Sim-ISCR) was applied to the top 15 cm layer. An equivalent of 9.8 years of effective rainfall was simulated during the 451 days of the experiments. CLD and seven TPs were analyzed in soils, soil pore waters and outflow waters of the lysimeters before and after the Sim-ISCR. CLD concentration in the soil pore waters increases with depth. In the Sim-ISCR treated layer, the CLD contamination was lowered by 41 to 47\% in the soil and by 48 to 73\% in the soil pore water. In the lysimeters outflow, however, the CLD concentration was lowered by only 13 to 25\%, the flux of CLD from the untreated 50--55 cm of the profile concealing much of the beneficial impact of treating the top 15 cm. Remediating by ISCR the topsoil only will therefore not be sufficient for preventing further CLD contamination of the underlying groundwater. Sim-ISCR generated 5-hydroCLD in soils and waters and, to a much lesser extent, a trihydroCLD, a tetrahydroCLD, a pentahydroCLD and a heptahydroCLD. 5-hydroCLD is more mobile than CLD, but it still interacts strongly with the soil. The 5-hydroCLD values measured in the outflow were up to a factor of 4.4 lower than in the treated soil pore waters, indicating some natural attenuation.},

The distribution of the various major and trace elements in all the sampling sites do not follow any systematic trend but vary from point to point. To assess the level of contamination and the possible anthropogenic impact in the clay soils, the enrichment factor (EF) and the geoaccumulation index (Igeo) were estimated for some potential hazardous elements.

  abstract = {Induced polarization (IP) imaging is being increasingly used in near-surface geophysical studies, particularly for hydrogeologic and environmental applications. However, the analysis of IP data error has received little attention, even though the importance of an adequate error parameterization has been demonstrated for electrical resistivity imaging. Based on the analysis of data sets measured in the frequency range from 1 Hz to 1 kHz, we proposed a model for the quantification of phase data errors in IP measurements. The analyzed data sets were collected on an experimental tank containing targets of different polarizability. Our study is based on the common practice that the discrepancy of measurements taken in normal and reciprocal configuration can be considered as a measure of data error. Statistical analysis of the discrepancies between normal and reciprocal measurements revealed that the phase error decreases with increasing resistance (i.e., signal strength). We proposed an inverse power-law model to quantify the phase error as a function of the measured resistances. We found that the adequate implementation of the proposed error model in an inversion scheme leads to improved IP imaging results in laboratory experiments. Application to a data set collected at the field-scale also demonstrated the superiority of the new model over previous assumptions.},

This uncertainty is manifested by the fact that ground-water contaminants often migrate along preferred pathways formed by lateral and vertical heterogeneity within definable stratigraphic units. A somewhat obscure surface, electrical geophysical method first suggested in 1920 holds great promise as a tool to help delineate conductive contaminant plumes in suitable hydrogeologic environments. This tool known as the mise-a'-la-masse method has been used with success by other investigators to map conductive orebodies.             A modified mise-a'-la-masse method was used with great success in this investigation during a controlled field experiment. The method was used to track the evolution of a conductive tracer plume migrating through fluvial sands and gravels under a forced hydraulic gradient. Voltage differences between 171 stationary, surface electrodes and a reference electrode were monitored over time to map an evolving tracer plume. For this particular experiment, the method proved to be sensitive to changes in the specific electrical conductance of the ground water of less than 10\% above the baseline values. Data derived by the modified mise-a'-la-masse method show close agreement to specific electrical conductance measurements of ground-water samples collected from wells during the tracer experiment. However, uncertainty in the significance of the variable specific electrical conductance data, especially at early times during the experiment, is reduced greatly by comparison with the plume maps generated by the modified mise-a'-la-masse method.},

Contaminant plumes that exhibit `Gaussian' (statistically normal) concentration distributions form trending heterogeneities with respect to electrical conductivity. These plumes are relatively poor conductors with electrical conductivity decreasing continuously with distance outward from the contaminant source in the directions of plume migration. Thus, electrical flow from a single, current electrode placed in the source of a contaminant plume refracts continuously with distance from the source as the current flows preferentially through the plume. Changes in the electrical potential field that occur at the land surface due to the presence of an evolving plume can be used to monitor the growth of the plume. ᭧ 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},

  abstract = {Electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is investigated as a non-destructive method for monitoring root growth of tomato. This paper aims to (i) review the basic principles of EIS applied to the characterisation of the different parts of the soil--root--stem-electrode continuum, (ii) experiment the validity of the relationship between root weight and root capacitance taking into account the influence of the soil and plant electrodes position, (iii) describe an EIS analysis of the root growth of tomato plants. All experiments were carried out in 50 dm3 containers either in hydroponics at 930 lS for the test of root fresh or dry weight and root capacitance relationships, or in a potting mix (oxisol) for electrode placement tests and EIS estimation of root growth. Electrical measurements of the soil--root--stem-electrode continuum were done with a twoelectrode measuring system using unpolarisable Ag--AgCl electrodes. A `root cutting' and a `progressively immersed root system' experiments were carried out in order to validate the relationship between root capacitance and root mass at 1 kHz. The effects of soil electrode and plant electrode placement were also tested, pointing out the sensitivity of the method to the insertion height of the ``plant electrode'' into the stem. For the root growth experiment, Impedance Spectra (IS) measurements were made just before harvesting the roots for dry weight and length determination. Measurements were made 14, 22, 26 and 39 days after planting, until flowering. The IS of the soil--root--stem-electrode continuum was modelled by a lumped electric circuit consisting of a series resistor R0 for the soil and of four parallel resistance (Ri)capacitance (Ci) circuits for the other components of the circuit. The model had nine parameters whose values were estimated by Complex Nonlinear Least Squares curve fitting. A stepwise ascendant regression was used to identify the electrical parameters that better correlated with root dry mass or length increment: C3 and C4 were well correlated with root dry mass with a r2 of 0.975, whereas root length was explained by the combination of 1/R3, C3, 1/R2 and 1/R1 with a r2 of 0.986. This work may be considered as a new methodological contribution to the understanding of root electrical properties in the non-destructive diagnosis of root systems.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Soil water retention curve (SWRC) plays an important role in simulating soil water movement and assessing soil water holding capacity and availability. Comparison of fitness between different models to determine the best SWRC model of specific regions is required. In this study, three popular models, van Genuchten, Brooks Corey and Gardner model, were selected for comparing in a degraded alpine meadow region on the eastern Tibetan Plateau. Fitness, error distribution along with key parameters were compared. For each soil horizon, the soil moisture content at all soil water potentials decreased consistently with degradation, thereby integrally moving the SWRCs of all soil depths downward with degradation. The differences in SWRCs across various degradation degrees diminished along with soil depth and soil water potential. The Adj.               r               2               values of van Genuchten, Brooks Corey and Gardner models ranged in 0.971--0.995, 0.958--0.997, and 0.688--0.909, respectively. The van Genuchten and Brooks Corey models significantly (               p               \,{$<$}\,0.05) outperformed the Gardner model, and have no significant differences in fitness. The fitness of all three models showed no significant changes with degradation. Regardless of degradation degree and soil depth, the fitting error of van Genuchten and Brooks Corey models was mainly distributed in the higher (from --100 hPa to --500 hPa) and lower (below --10000 hPa) potential sections. With regard to the parameters of van Genuchten and Brooks Corey models, the field capacity (               {\texttheta}               s), and permanent wilting moisture were highly coherent with Adj.               r               2               values of higher than 0.98, while the curve shape parameter (               {\texttheta}               r), and air entry pressure of the Brooks Corey model were much lower than those of the van Genuchten model with Adj.               r               2               values of lower than 0.91. The SWRCs with varying degrees of degradation are best fitted by both van Genuchten and Brooks Corey models but cannot be fitted by Gardner model. Soil water holding capacity decreased with degradation especially in the top soil (0\,cm to 30\,cm), but the curve shape of all SWRCs did not change significantly with degradation.},

  abstract = {The topsoil Land Use and Cover Area frame Statistical survey (LUCAS) aims at collecting harmonised data about the state of soil health over the extent of European Union (EU). In the LUCAS 2018 survey, bulk density has been analysed for three depths, i.e., 0--10 cm = 6140 sites; 10--20 cm = 5684 sites and 20--30 cm =139 sites. The laboratory analysis and the assessment of the results conclude that the bulk density at 10--20 cm is 5--10\% higher compared to 0--10 cm for all land uses except woodlands (20\%). In the 0--20 cm depth, croplands have 1.5 times higher bulk density (mean: 1.26 g cm 3) compared to woodlands (mean: 0.83 g cm 3). The main driver for bulk density variation is the land use which implies that many existing pedotransfer rules have to be developed based on land use. This study applied a methodological framework using an advanced Cubist rule-based regression model to optimize the spatial prediction of bulk density in Europe. We spatialised the circa 6000 LUCAS samples and developed the high-resolution map (100 m) of bulk density for the 0--20 cm depth and the maps at 0--10 and 10--20 cm depth. The modelling results showed a very good prediction (R2: 0.66) of bulk density for the 0--20 cm depth which outperforms previous assessments. The bulk density maps can be used to estimate packing density which is a proxy to estimate soil compaction. Therefore, this work contributes to monitoring soil health and refine estimates on carbon and nutrients stocks in the EU topsoil.},

The distribution will, to some extent, reflect the geometry of the ore mass of which the mineral show forms a part. In a n\&e-a-la-masse survey of a lead-zinc deposit in Central Sweden electric potentials were measured on the surface of the ground as well as in some 25 drillholes, in either case with earthings (successively) in three different parts of the irregular ore deposit. Besides this, measurements were made in drillholes with earthings in two further drillholes. Geologic correlation between the drillholes is difficult in the present case on account of the irregular geometry of the ore deposit. However, the mise-a-la-masse measurements clearly showed the dip and the pitch of the ore body, established connections between the different ore widths encountered in the various holes, and yielded information about the shape of the ore mass. In particular, the survey showed that the ore lenses must be crescent-shaped rather than tabular, and the dip was indicated to be westerly, instead of easterly as originally presumed. Three-dimensional models of equipotential surfaces were constructed from the observed drillhole and surface potentials (using transparent plastic sheets and thin copper wire) and these helped to elucidate the mass geometry further. The surface and underground potential data collected in the present case should be of nterest to geophysicists working on analytic continuation problems.},

  abstract = {To increase crop yield per unit of scarce water requires both better cultivars and better agronomy. The challenge is to manage the crop or improve its genetic makeup to: capture more of the water supply for use in transpiration; exchange transpired water for CO2 more effectively in producing biomass; and convert more of the biomass into grain or other harvestable product. In the field, the upper limit of water productivity of well-managed disease-free water-limited cereal crops is typically 20 kg ha{\`A}1 mm{\`A}1 (grain yield per water used). If the productivity is markedly less than this, it is likely that major stresses other than water are at work, such as weeds, diseases, poor nutrition, or inhospitable soil. If so, the greatest advances will come from dealing with these first. When water is the predominant limitation, there is scope for improving overall water productivity by better matching the development of the crop to the pattern of water supply, thereby reducing evaporative and other losses and fostering a good balance of water-use before and after flowering, which is needed to give a large harvest index. There is also scope for developing genotypes that are able to maintain adequate floret fertility despite any transient severe water deficits during floral development. Markerassisted selection has helped in controlling some root diseases that limit water uptake, and in maintaining fertility in water-stressed maize. Apart from herbicide-resistance in crops, which helps reduce competition for water by weeds, there are no genetic transformations in the immediate offing that are likely to improve water productivity greatly.},

Large-scale surface electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) was used to perform a preliminary assessment of the structure in a thick unsaturated zone and to detect the presence of a thin layer of clay supporting an overlying thin perched aquifer. Discontinuities in this clay layer have an enormous impact on the infiltration processes of both water and solutes, including contaminants. In the case here presented, the technical strategy is to interrupt the continuity of the clay layer upstream of the investigated site in order to prevent most of the subsurface water flow from reaching the contaminated area. Therefore, a deep trench was dug upstream of the site and, in order to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach in facilitating water infiltration into the underlying aquifer, a forced infiltration experiment was carried out and monitored using ERT and ground-penetrating radar (GPR) measurements in a cross-hole time-lapse configuration. The results of the forced infiltration experiment are presented here, with a particular emphasis on the contribution of hydro-geophysical methods to the general understanding of the subsurface water dynamics at this complex site.},

In this paper fast nonstationary filtering method is applied, providing optimal tradeoff between response time and settling time of steady state value. The implementation method uses the distributed approach, where an intelligent sensor captures raw signal and applies adaptive filter. Subsequently, obtained value is transmitted to central unit, that applies weight compensation function to improve the measurement accuracy. All presented results use the real signal acquired in industrial conditions from the tests of sorting machine prototype. The analyzed approach obtains promising results for all sorting modes. Moreover, classical filtering approach is used for comparison purposes and performance evaluation.},

  abstract = {Landslide deformations involve approximately all geological materials (natural rocks, soil, artificial fill, or combinations of these materials) and can occur and develop in a large variety of volumes and shapes. The characterization of the material inhomogeneities and their properties, the study of the deformation processes, and the delimitation of boundaries and potential slip surfaces are not simple goals. Since the `70s, the international community (mainly geophysicists and lower geologists and geological engineers) has begun to employ, together with other techniques, geophysical methods to characterize and monitor landslides. Both the associated advantages and limitations have been highlighted over the years, and some drawbacks are still open. This review is focused on works of the last twelve years (2007-2018), and the main goal is to analyse the geophysical community efforts toward overcoming the geophysical technique limitations highlighted in the 2007 geophysics and landslide review. To achieve this aim, contrary to previous reviews that analysed the advantages and limitations of each technique using a ``technique approach,'' the analysis was carried out using a ``material landslide approach'' on the basis of the more recent landslides classification.},

HYDRUS overpredicted RWU from diseased trees, requiring a compensation mechanism.                                                           Parameters defining the root distribution were optimized considering plant health.                                                                                   Variably saturated flow models that simulate soil--water--plant interactions within the rhizosphere largely ignore the effect of plant health. This makes it difficult for them to effectively simulate root water uptake (RWU) and implement alternate management practices for diseased trees. This research was aimed at understanding the hydrological and plant controls on RWU simulations dominated by the health of the tree using experimental and numerical frameworks. Two research plots, one around a healthy mature and the other around a diseased mature (                 Phytophthora                 spp. affected) orange tree (                 Citrus reticulate                 Blanco), in the Vidarbha region of India were considered for our analysis. Three-dimensional electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) performed at the two locations revealed that the soil moisture profiles following irrigation are different between the two plots. A two-dimensional axisymmetric form of Richards' equation was then solved using HYDRUS (2D/3D) by incorporating a root distribution function. A global sensitivity analysis was performed to identify the root distribution parameters that influence soil moisture simulations. These parameters were then optimized using a genetic algorithm for healthy and diseased conditions. We observed that the diseased orange tree had consumed less water, leaving high soil moisture in the rhizosphere, a condition favorable for the further growth of disease-causing fungi. Hence, managing irrigation water in accordance with RWU patterns is essential for diseased trees. To understand the error propagation in RWU estimation, we simulated RWU from a diseased tree with the optimal parameters derived for a healthy case. Results show that the error in estimating RWU from the model cells progressively increases with radial distance and soil depth.},

  abstract = {Two theoretical approaches to evaporation from saturated surfaces are outlined, the first being on an aerodynamic basis in which evaporation is regarded as due to turbulent transport of vapour by a process of eddy diffusion, and the second being on an energy basis in which evaporation is regarded as one of the ways of degrading incoming radiation. Neither approach is new, but a combination is suggested that eliminates the parameter measured with most difficulty---surface temperature---and provides for the first time an opportunity to make theoretical estimates of evaporation rates from standard meteorological data, estimates that can be retrospective. Experimental work to test these theories shows that the aerodynamic approach is not adequate and an empirical expression, previously obtained in America, is a better description of evaporation from open water. The energy balance is found to be quite successful. Evaporation rates from wet bare soil and from turf with an adequate supply of water are obtained as fractions of that from open water, the fraction for turf showing a seasonal change attributed to the annual cycle of length of daylight. Finally, the experimental results are applied to data published elsewhere and it is shown that a satisfactory account can be given of open water evaporation at four widely spaced sites in America and Europe, the results for bare soil receive a reasonable check in India, and application of the results for turf shows good agreement with estimates of evaporation from catchment areas in the British Isles.},

The data have been collected during two summer seasons (2005 and 2006) with different precipitation distribution. Analysis of soil moisture data shows that different physical processes control the space--time distribution of soil moisture at the three soil depths, with a marked effect of dew on the 0--6 cm soil depth layer. The range of skewness values decreases markedly from the surface to deeper layers. More symmetric distributions, characterised by relatively low skewness, are found for mid-range soil moisture contents, while highly skewed distributions (generally with more log--normal shape) are found at dry and wet conditions. Scatter plots drawn for the whole data set and the analysis of the correlation coefficients suggest a good persistence of soil moisture with depth: the highest degree of correlation was observed between data collected at 0--12 and 0--20 cm.},

The capacity of soil to recover from the degradation caused by fire disturbance depends on fire history, ash properties, topography, post-fire weather, vegetation recuperation and post-fire management. These factors are interdependent, and can increase or decrease the effects of high severity fires on soil degradation. Normally, ecosystems are resilient to fire disturbance and a scenario of no intervention should be considered. Post-fire management should be carried out in specific areas that are more susceptible to degradation. Post-fire interventions such as mulching are important to decrease soil degradation, whereas salvage logging increases it. Overall, the management options that we choose can trigger or reduce positive and negative impacts on soil.},

The experimental site is located in the upper part of the Alento River alluvial plain (Campania Region, Southern Italy). In this paper we present the hydrogeological setting, the experimental setup and the relevant field results. Subsequently, we compare those data against the simulated results obtained with a 3D resistivity model of the test area, coupled with a model describing the Advection -- Dispersion equation for continuous tracer injection. In particular, we calculate a series of 3D forward solutions starting from a reference model, all derived from electrical tomography results, but taking into consideration different values of mean flow velocity and directions. Each electrical resistivity 3D model is used to produce synthetic voltage maps for MALM surveys. Finally, the synthetic MALM voltage maps are compared with the ones measured in the field in order to assess the information content of the MALM dataset with respect to the groundwater field characteristics. The results demonstrate that the information content of the MALM data is sufficient to define important characteristics of the aquifer geometry and properties. This work shows how a combination of three-dimensional time-lapse modeling of flow, tracer transport and electrical current can substantially contribute towards a quantitative interpretation of MALM measurements during a saline tracer test. This approach can thus revive the use of MALM as a practical, low cost field technique for tracer test monitoring and aquifer hydrodynamic characterization.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            Electrical resistivity tomography is a technique widely used for the investigation of the structure and fluid dynamics of the shallow subsurface, particularly for hydro-geophysical purposes, sometimes using cross-borehole configurations. The results of electrical resistivity tomography inversion and their usefulness in solving hydrogeophysical problems, even though invariably limited by resolution issues, depend strongly on the accuracy of inversion, which in turn depends on a proper estimation and handling of data and model errors. Among model errors, one approximation often applied in cross-hole electrical resistivity tomography is that of neglecting the effects of boreholes and the fluids therein. Such effects inevitably impact the current and potential patterns as measured by electrodes in the boreholes themselves. In the presence of very saline fluids, in particular, this model approximation may prove inadequate and the tomographic inversion may yield images strongly contaminated by artefacts. In this paper, we present a case study where highly saline water was used for hydraulic fracturing to improve permeability of a shallow formation impacted by hydrocarbon contamination, with the final aim of improving the effectiveness of               in situ               contaminant oxidation. The hydraulic fracturing was monitored via time-lapse cross-hole electrical resistivity tomography. Arrival of the saline water in the monitoring borehole likely caused a strong borehole effect that significantly affected the quality and usefulness of electrical resistivity tomography inversions. In this paper, we analyse the experimental dataset and produce, via three-dimensional electrical resistivity tomography forward modelling, a viable explanation for the observed, paradoxical field results.},

We performed laboratory column experiments to investigate the geoelectrical response of iron sulfide transformations by               Desulfovibrio vulgaris               . Two geoelectrical methods, (1) spectral induced polarization (SIP), and (2) electrodic potential measurements, were investigated. Aqueous geochemistry (sulfate, lactate, sulfide, and acetate), observations of precipitates (identified from electron microscopy as iron sulfide), and electrodic potentials on bisulfide ion (HS               -               ) sensitive silver-silver chloride (Ag-AgCl) electrodes ({$\sim-$}630 mV) were diagnostic of induced transitions between anaerobic iron sulfide forming conditions and aerobic conditions promoting iron sulfide dissolution. The SIP data showed {$\sim$}10 mrad anomalies during iron sulfide mineralization accompanying microbial activity under an anaerobic transition. These anomalies disappeared during iron sulfide dissolution under the subsequent aerobic transition. SIP model parameters based on a Cole-Cole relaxation model of the polarization at the mineral-fluid interface were converted to (1) estimated biomineral surface area to pore volume (               S                                p                              ), and (2) an equivalent polarizable sphere diameter (               d               ) controlling the relaxation time. The temporal variation in these model parameters is consistent with filling and emptying of pores by iron sulfide biofilms, as the system transitions between anaerobic (pore filling) and aerobic (pore emptying) conditions. The results suggest that combined SIP and electrodic potential measurements might be used to monitor spatiotemporal variability in microbial iron sulfide transformations in the field.},

  abstract = {Adsorption at the solid-pore fluid interface is a key mechanism controlling the mobility of nutrients and contaminants in subsurface soils and sediments. The spectral induced polarization (SIP) method has been shown to be sensitive to the quantity and type of adsorbed ions. Extending previous results, we investigated the relevance of pH, solution conductivity, and ion type on the SIP response of saturated silica sand. We also performed adsorption experiments to evaluate whether adsorption plays a relevant role on the effect of saturating solution conductivity and pH. Given their environmental relevance and different electrochemical characteristics, we focused on exploring the influence of Cu2+ and Na+ adsorption on the SIP signature. The adsorption results confirm the expected and modeled pH influence on the adsorption of both Cu2+ and Na+. The measured quadrature conductivity spectra indicate that pH and solution conductivity control the electrical double layer electrochemical state and its capacitive behavior. On the contrary, no appreciable SIP signal changes are associated with ion substitution. The adsorption experiments highlight low values of site occupancy for Na and Cu, which suggests that the effects of pH and fluid conductivity are unrelated to their control on the ion adsorption. We interpret the solution conductivity as a proxy for ionic strength. The relative importance of pH and solution conductivity over ion type helps to further constrain the interpretation of SIP results in field geochemical and biogeochemical characterization and monitoring.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Aims               The flow of electric current in the root-soil system relates to the pathways of water and solutes, its characterization provides information on the root architecture and functioning. We developed a current source density approach with the goal of non-invasively image the current pathways in the root-soil system.                                         Methods               A current flow is applied from the plant stem to the soil, the proposed geoelectrical approach images the resulting distribution and intensity of the electric current in the root-soil system. The numerical inversion procedure underlying the approach was tested in numerical simulations and laboratory experiments with artificial metallic roots. We validated the method using rhizotron laboratory experiments on maize and cotton plants.                                         Results               Results from numerical and laboratory tests showed that our inversion approach was capable of imaging root-like distributions of the current source. In maize and cotton, roots acted as ``leaky conductors'', resulting in successful imaging of the root crowns and negligible contribution of distal roots to the current flow. In contrast, the electrical insulating behavior of the cotton stems in dry soil supports the hypothesis that suberin layers can affect the mobility of ions and water.                                         Conclusions               The proposed approach with rhizotrons studies provides the first direct and concurrent characterization of the root-soil current pathways and their relationship with root functioning and architecture. This approach fills a major gap toward non-destructive imaging of roots in their natural soil environment.},

  abstract = {Precision agriculture directly points at both spatial and temporal variabilities, to be mapped and monitored with relevant technologies. With regard to the subsurface, soil sensors remain the foremost driver of precision agriculture. These sensors provide high temporal resolution information on key soil variables, including volumetric water content. However, their limited representativeness and high sensitivity to local and installation factors are intrinsic and well known issues. Cosmic ray neutron sensing (CRNS) is a newer technology that addresses these issues, with the water content information being integrated over a footprint of several tens of meters. Nonetheless, the integrated water information remains a one-dimensional time series. The interplay of different spatial scales of the measurements and unknown subsurface heterogeneity ultimately hinders the correct interpretation of the individual time series, and their discrepancies.In this work we explore how geophysics-based soil heterogeneity supports the interpretation of time series from soil water sensors and cosmic ray neutron sensing. We present a case study from a vineyard in the Chianti region (Siena, Italy). We focus on the joint use of electrical resistivity tomography and frequency-domain electromagnetic induction. Two field campaigns, conducted in April and November 2024, highlight significant differences in both soil composition (clay content) and soil depth over the vineyard. Before the geophysical campaign, the soil water sensors were installed in a region with particularly deep and clayey soil. On the contrary, the cosmic ray was installed at the center of the vineyard and thus responds to regions with dominant water dynamics. The results show that the differences in water dynamics between the clay-rich area (with the soil sensors) and the surrounding areas coupled with the larger CRNS sensitivity to faster-draining regions lead to significant discrepancies. The geophysics-based spatial information qualitatively explains these discrepancies and supports CRNS numerical simulations (Uranos) that aim to provide a more quantitative understanding.},

  abstract = {Weighing lysimeters yield the most precise and realistic measures for evapotranspiration (ET) and precipitation (P ), which are of great importance for many questions regarding soil and atmospheric sciences. An increase or a decrease of the system mass (lysimeter plus seepage) indicates P or ET. These real mass changes of the lysimeter system have to be separated from measurement noise (e.g., caused by wind). A promising approach to filter noisy lysimeter data is (i) to introduce a smoothing routine, like a moving average with a certain averaging window, w, and then (ii) to apply a certain threshold value, {$\delta$}, accounting for measurement accuracy, separating significant from insignificant weight changes. Thus, two filter parameters are used, namely w and {$\delta$}. In particular, the time-variable noise due to wind as well as strong signals due to heavy precipitation pose challenges for such noise-reduction algorithms. If w is too small, data noise might be interpreted as real system changes. If w is too wide, small weight changes in short time intervals might be disregarded. The same applies to too small or too large values for {$\delta$}. Application of constant w and {$\delta$} leads either to unnecessary losses of accuracy or to faulty data due to noise. The aim of this paper is to solve this problem with a new filter routine that is appropriate for any event, ranging from smooth evaporation to strong wind and heavy precipitation. Therefore, the new routine uses adaptive w and {$\delta$} in dependence on signal strength and noise (AWAT -- adaptive window and adaptive threshold filter). The AWAT filter, a moving-average filter and the Savitzky--Golay filter with constant w and {$\delta$} were applied to real lysimeter data comprising the above-mentioned events. The AWAT filter was the only filter that could handle the data of all events very well. A sensitivity study shows that the magnitude of the maximum threshold value has practically no influence on the results; thus only the maximum window width must be predefined by the user.},

  abstract = {Weighing lysimeters with appropriate data filtering yield the most precise and unbiased information for precipitation (P ) and evapotranspiration (ET). A recently introduced filter scheme for such data is the AWAT (Adaptive Window and Adaptive Threshold) filter (Peters et al., 2014). The filter applies an adaptive threshold to separate significant from insignificant mass changes, guaranteeing that P and ET are not overestimated, and uses a step interpolation between the significant mass changes. In this contribution we show that the step interpolation scheme, which reflects the resolution of the measuring system, can lead to unrealistic prediction of P and ET, especially if they are required in high temporal resolution. We introduce linear and spline interpolation schemes to overcome these problems. To guarantee that medium to strong precipitation events abruptly following low or zero fluxes are not smoothed in an unfavourable way, a simple heuristic selection criterion is used, which attributes such precipitations to the step interpolation. The three interpolation schemes (step, linear and spline) are tested and compared using a data set from a grass-reference lysimeter with 1 min resolution, ranging from 1 January to 5 August 2014. The selected output resolutions for P and ET prediction are 1 day, 1 h and 10 min. As expected, the step scheme yielded reasonable flux rates only for a resolution of 1 day, whereas the other two schemes are well able to yield reasonable results for any resolution. The spline scheme returned slightly better results than the linear scheme concerning the differences between filtered values and raw data. Moreover, this scheme allows continuous differentiability of filtered data so that any output resolution for the fluxes is sound. Since computational burden is not problematic for any of the interpolation schemes, we suggest always using the spline scheme.},

  abstract = {Weighing lysimeters are considered to be the best means for a precise measurement of water fluxes at the interface between the soil-plant system and the atmosphere. Any decrease of the net mass of the lysimeter can be interpreted as evapotranspiration (ET), any increase as precipitation (P). However, the measured raw data need to be filtered to separate real mass changes from noise. Such filter routines typically apply two steps: (i) a low pass filter, like moving average, which smooths noisy data, and (ii) a threshold filter that separates significant from insignificant mass changes. Recent developments of these filters have identified and solved some problems regarding bias in the data processing. A remaining problem is that each change in flow direction is accompanied with a systematic flow underestimation due to the threshold scheme. In this contribution, we analyze this systematic effect and show that the absolute underestimation is independent of the magnitude of a flux event. Thus, for small events, like dew or rime formation, the relative error is high and can reach the same magnitude as the flux itself. We develop a heuristic solution to the problem by introducing a so-called ``snap routine''. The routine is calibrated and tested with synthetic flux data and applied to real measurements obtained with a precision lysimeter for a 10-month period. The heuristic snap routine effectively overcomes these problems and yields an almost unbiased representation of the real signal.},

The construction of new small water infrastructures (SWIs), such as deep wells and boreholes, is increasingly supported by climate resilience programmes of non-governmental organizations and national governments to improve water availability for agro-pastoralists, especially as an emergency response to extreme droughts. Although the short-term benefits of SWI are clear, their potential cumulative impact and their long-term effects on the resilience of dryland communities remain unclear. Here, building on in-depth anthropological literature from five key African drylands, we model post-drought pastoralists' dynamics related to SWI. We show that while developing new SWI releases water shortages in the short term, it can erode traditional adaptation practices without adequate governance. We further illustrate how our model captures early quantitative signals of resilience loss in dryland Angola. This indicates that poorly governed water development in African drylands can be a limiting factor for the long-term resilience of pastoral communities facing a range of social, demographic, economic and climate challenges.},

  abstract = {Evaluating the lateral saturated hydraulic conductivity, Ks,l, of soil horizons is crucial for understanding and modelling the subsurface flow dynamics in many shallow hill soils. A Ks,l measurement method should be able to catch the effects of soil heterogeneities governing hydrological processes at the scale of interest, in order to yield Ks,l representative values over large spatial scales. This study aims to develop a field technique to determine spatially representative Ks,l values of soil horizons of an experimental hillslope. Drainage experiments were performed on soil monoliths of about 0.12 m3 volume, encased in situ with polyurethane foam. Median Ks,l of 2450 mm{$\cdot$}h-1 and 552 mm{$\cdot$}h-1 were estimated in the A and B horizon, respectively. In the upper part of the B horizon, the median Ks,l was 490 mm{$\cdot$}h-1, whereas it mostly halved near the underlying restricting layer. The decline of Ks,l values with depth was consistent with the water-table dynamics observed at the same site in previous studies. Moreover, the Ks,l from the monoliths were in line with large spatial-scale Ks,l values reported from the hillslope in a prior investigation based on drain data analysis. This indicated that the large-scale hydrological effects of the macropore network were well represented in the investigated soil blocks. Our findings suggest that performing drainage experiments on large-volume monoliths is a promising method for characterizing lateral conductivities over large spatial scales. This information could improve our understanding of hydrological processes and can be used to parameterize runoff-generation models at hillslope and catchment scale.},

  abstract = {Background:{\enspace} To face climate change and subsequent rainfall instabilities, crop breeding strategies now include root traits phenotyping. Rapid estimation of root traits in controlled conditions can be achieved by using parallel electrical capacitance and its linear correlation with root dry mass. The aim of the present study was to improve robustness and efficiency of methods based on capacitance and other electrical variables, such as serial/parallel resistance, conductance, impedance or reactance. Using different electrode configurations and stem contact electrodes, we have measured the electrical impedance spectra of wheat plants grown in pots filled with three types of soil. Results:{\enspace} For each configuration, parallel capacitance and other linearly independent electrical variables were computed and their quality as root dry mass estimator was evaluated by a `sensitivity score' that we derived from Pearson's correlation coefficient r and linear regression parameters. The highest sensitivity score was obtained by parallel capacitance at an alternating current frequency of 116 Hz in three-terminal configuration. Using a clamp, instead of a needle, as a stem electrode did not significantly affect the capacitance measurements. Finally, in handheld LCR meter equivalent conditions, capacitance had the highest sensitivity score and determination coefficient (r2 = 0.52) at 10 kHz frequency. Conclusion:{\enspace} Our benchmarking of linear correlations between different electrical variables and root dry mass enables to determine more coherent practices for ensuring a sensitive and robust root dry mass estimation, including in handheld LCR meter conditions. This would enhance the value of electrical capacitance as a tool for screening crops in relation with root systems in breeding programs.},

For first-year potted saplings ͑n ϭ 33͒, strong linear and positive correlations were found between both root dry mass ͑adjusted r2 ϭ 0.895, P Ͻ 0.001͒ and root fresh mass ͑adjusted r2 ϭ 0.866, P Ͻ 0.001͒ and root electrical capacitance for the particular DN hybrid poplar clone studied. When augmented with data from third-year DN saplings grown in a more harsh landfill environment, a somewhat less strong curvilinear relationship was indicated with root dry mass ͑adjusted r2 ϭ 0.780, P Ͻ 0.001, n ϭ 50͒.

  abstract = {Microbial ecology, the scientific study of interactions between natural microbial communities and their environments, has been facilitated by the application of molecular and `omics'-based techniques that overcome some of the limitations of cultivation-based studies. This has increased emphasis on community ecology and `microbiome' studies, but the majority address technical, rather than scientific challenges. Most are descriptive, do not address scientific aims or questions and are not designed to increase understanding or test hypotheses. The term `hypothesis' is increasingly misused and critical testing of ideas or theory is restricted to a small minority of studies. This article discusses current microbial ecology research within the context of four approaches: description, induction, inference to the best explanation and deduction. The first three of these do not follow the established scientific method and are not based on scientific ecological questions. Observations are made and sometimes compared with published data, sometimes with attempts to explain findings in the context of existing ideas or hypotheses, but all lack objectivity and are biased by the observations made. By contrast, deductive studies address ecological questions and attempt to explain currently unexplained phenomena through the construction of hypotheses, from mechanism-based assumptions, that generate predictions that are then tested experimentally. Identification of key scientific questions, research driven by meaningful hypotheses and adoption of scientific method are essential for progress in microbial ecology, rather than the current emphasis on descriptive approaches that address only technical challenges. It is, therefore, imperative that we carefully consider and define the fundamental scientific questions that drive our own research and focus on ideas, concepts and hypotheses that can increase understanding, and only then consider which techniques are required for experimental testing.             This article is part of the theme issue `Conceptual challenges in microbial community ecology'.},

The accurate estimation of PET is typically data demanding, while specific climatic, geographical and local factors may further complicate this task. Especially in city environments, where built-up structures may highly influence the micrometeorological conditions and urban green sites may occupy limited spaces, the selection of proper PET estimation approaches is critical, considering also data availability issues. In this study, a wide variety of empirical PET methods were evaluated against the FAO56 Penman--Monteith benchmark method in the environment of two Mediterranean urban green sites in Greece, aiming to investigate their accuracy and suitability under specific local conditions. The methods under evaluation cover all the range of empirical PET estimations: namely, mass transfer-based, temperature-based, radiation-based, and combination approaches, including 112 methods. Furthermore, 15 locally calibrated and adjusted models have been developed based on the general forms of the mass transfer, temperature, and radiation equations, improving the performance of the original models for local application. Among the 127 (112 original and 15 adjusted) evaluated methods, the radiation-based methods and adjusted models performed overall better than the temperature-based and the mass transfer methods, whereas the data-demanding combination methods received the highest ranking scores. The adjusted models seem to give accurate PET estimates for local use, while they might be applied in sites with similar conditions after proper validation.},

The extraction of heavy metals from soil by un-buffered salt solutions is a method used to estimate soil contamination and trace metal availability to plants. The present study assesses three of these methods. All the three methods are standardised or is undergoing standardisation in Europe: 0.01 mol l-1 CaCl2 (The Netherlands), 0.1 mol l-1 NaNO3 (Switzerland) and 1 mol l-1 NH4NO3 (Germany). The soil-reference material BCR CRM 483, with indicative values for CaCl2, NaNO3, NH4NO3 extractable metals, was analysed for quality control purposes. The three methods were also applied to 10 contaminated soils and the extracted metals (Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn) were determined. The procedures were found to be precise (typically {$<$}10\%) for all metals, taking into account the low metal concentrations extracted. The metal extraction efficiency obtained with each procedure was slightly different, and the three methods provided equivalent information while predicting the relative trace-metal mobility (Cd {$>$} Zn {$>$} Cu {$>$} Pb) in the soils studied. From the experience obtained, the 0.01 mol l-1 CaCl2 extraction procedure seems to be the most suitable method for performing a harmonisation process, since this procedure combines an appropriate extraction capacity for this type of studies with the lowest salt concentration in the extracts and, consequently, with a more simple matrix for metal determination.},

  abstract = {The temperature difference between an urban space and surrounding non-urban space is called the urban heat island effect (UHI). Global terrestrial evapotranspiration (ET) can consume 1.4803{\texttimes}1023 joules (J) of energy annually, which is about 21.74\% of the total available solar energy at the top of atmosphere, whereas annual human energy use is 4.935{\texttimes}1020 J, about 0.33\% of annual ET energy consumption. Vegetation ET has great potential to reduce urban and global temperatures. Our literature review suggests that vegetation and urban agricultural ET can reduce urban temperatures by 0.5 to 4.0{$^\circ$}C. Green roofs (including urban agriculture) and water bodies have also been shown to be effective ways of reducing urban temperatures. The cooling effects on the ambient temperature and the roof surface temperature can be 0.24-4.0{$^\circ$}C and 0.8-60.0{$^\circ$}C, respectively. The temperature of a water body (including urban aquaculture) can be lower than the temperature of the surrounding built environment by between 2 and 6{$^\circ$}C, and a water body with a 16 m2 surface area can cool up to 2 826 m3 of nearby space by 1{$^\circ$}C. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that the increase of evapotranspiration in cities, derived from vegetation, urban agriculture, and water body, can effectively mitigate the effect of urban heat islands.},

  abstract = {The English polymath Lewis Fry Richardson (1881--1953) made important contributions to many fields, including numerical weather prediction, finite difference solutions of partial differential equations, turbulent flow and diffusion, fractals, and the cause and evolution of conflicts. His first papers in 1908 concerned unconfined flow of water in saturated soil, arising in the design of required ditch spacing for draining peat. He developed and used a graphical method to solve this problem. This and other practical problems stimulated his interest in numerical methods and soon led him to the challenge of numerical weather prediction. In 1922 he published the book Weather Prediction by Numerical Process. He did the research for this book under difficult circumstances just before, during, and right after World War I. The book was received positively, but methods like those proposed in it were not successfully implemented until the invention of fast digital computers around 1950. Posthumously, most of Richardson{$\prime$}s contributions in various fields received considerable attention. Important exceptions are his contributions to soil science and hydrology, on which we focus in this paper. In his 1922 book, Richardson formulated an elaborate model for transport processes in the atmosphere. For the lower boundary of his atmospheric model, he needed to understand the movement of liquid water, water vapor, and heat in the upper layer of the soil, and at the soil-atmosphere and plant-atmosphere interfaces. Finding little previous work on this, he first of all formulated the partial differential equation for transient, vertical flow of liquid water in soil. We argue that the resulting equation can rightly be called the Richardson-Richards equation. In addition he formulated equations for simultaneous transfer of liquid water and water vapor, for transfer of heat in soil, and for the balances of water and energy at the soil-atmosphere and plant-atmosphere interfaces. Finite difference versions of all the equations were incorporated in the numerical weather forecasting model. Unfortunately, his results were hardly noticed by soil physicists and hydrologists, likely because they were too effectively buried in an intimidating book on weather prediction.},

Reliable prediction of FC and PWP from their functional relationships with routinely measured soil properties can help to circumvent these constraints. This study provided measured data on FC using undisturbed samples and PWP as functions of geomorphological unit, soil type, and soil texture class for dryland cropping soils of north-western Victoria. We used a balanced, nested sampling strategy and developed functional relationships of FC and PWP with routinely measured soil properties using residual maximum likelihood based mixed-effects regression modelling. Using the data, we also tested the adequacy of nine published pedotransfer functions (PTFs) in predicting FC and PWP.},

  abstract = {Formation of inner- and outer-sphere complexes of environmentally important divalent ions on the goethite surface was examined by applying the charge distribution CD model for inner- and outer-sphere complexation. The model assumes spatial charge distribution between the surface (0-plane) and the next electrostatic plane (1-plane) for innersphere complexation and between the 1-plane and the head end of the diffuse double layer (2-plane) for the outersphere complexation. The latter approach has been used because the distance of closest approach to a charged surface may differ for different ions. The surface structural approach implies the use of a Three-Plane model for the compact part (Stern layer) of solid--solution interface, which is divided into two layers. The thickness of each layer depends on the capacitance and the local dielectric constant. The new approach has been applied to describe the adsorption of magnesium, calcium, strontium, and sulfate ions. It is shown that the concept can successfully describe the development of surface charge in the presence of Ca+2, Mg+2, Sr+2, and SO-4 2 as a function of loading, pH, and salt level, and also the shift in the isoelectric point (IEP) of goethite. The CD modeling revealed that, for the conditions studied, magnesium is mainly adsorbed as a bidentate innersphere complex, calcium can be a combination of bidentate innersphere and a monodentate inner- or outer-sphere complexes, and strontium is probably adsorbed as an outersphere complex. Sulfate is present as a mixture of inner- and outersphere monodentate complexes. Outersphere complexation is less pH dependent than innersphere complexation. The CD model predicts that the outersphere complexation of divalent cations and anions is relatively favorable at respectively low and high pH. Increase of ion loading favors the formation of innersphere complexes.},

  abstract = {With the growth of the global market for quality grains, the concerns over grain quality and its best monetary value also increased. This situation urged the grain management industry and farmers to focus their investment and efforts on efficient and reliable grain quality management techniques. The traditional method of relying on the approximation of grain quality and condition with grain temperature and predicted moisture contents or with random grain quality checks is not good enough to ensure competitive value for food-grade grain in the global market. Hence, researchers and grain industries are focusing on an integrated approach of in-bin stored grain quality management using carbon dioxide measurement along with temperature and moisture monitoring. The large-scale acceptance of this approach is still in progress. The present review synthesizes and coalesces the research work done in grain quality monitoring techniques and their effectiveness in detecting the grain spoilage, the role of CO2 in a grain storage environment, and the potential of using CO2 sensing and monitoring techniques for early detection of spoilage in grains. The latter section of this paper discusses the phenomena of CO2 movement in bulk grain and the role of different types of commercial CO2 sensors in grain storage and the research gaps in its utilization in grain quality management. This review provides a significant understanding of the importance of faster and efficient methods for detecting grain spoilage and the knowledge gap and potential research opportunities in monitoring methods for stored grain quality management.},

Malnutrition persists among large sections of the population, and a new epidemic of obesity is on the rise. We review both the successes and failures of the global food system, addressing ongoing debates on pathways to environmental health and food security.

We evaluated the capability of ERT to monitor changes in the soil resistivity during the steam injection process using a dipole-dipole measurement technique to measure the bulk electrical resistivity distribution in the soil mass. The injected steam caused changes in the soil's resistivity because the steam displaced some of the native pore water, increased the pore water and soil temperatures and changed the ionic content of the pore water. We could detect the effects of steam invasion by mapping changes in the soil resistivity as a function of space and time. The ERT tomographs are compared with induction well logs, formation temperature logs and lithologic logs. These comparisons suggest that the ERT tomographs mapped the formation regions invaded by the steam flood. The data also suggest that steam invasion was limited in vertical extent to a gravel horizon at depth of approximately 43 m. The tomographs show that with time, the steam invasion zone extended laterally to all areas monitored by the ERT technique.},

In general, the environments are arid and semi-arid with summers characterised by high temperatures and small precipitation. Due to the scarcity of water resources, the correct evaluation of water losses by the crops as evapotranspiration (ET) is very important in these regions. In this paper, we initially present the most known ET measurement methods classified according to the used approach: hydrological, micrometeorological and plant physiological. In the following, we describe the methods to estimate ET, distinguishing the methods based on analytical approaches from the methods based on empirical approaches. Ten methods are reviewed: soil water balance, weighing lysimeter, energy balance/Bowen ratio, aerodynamic method, eddy covariance, sap flow method, chambers system, Penman -- Monteith model, crop coefficient approach and soil water balance modelling approach. In the presentation of each method, we have recalled the basic principles, underlined the time and space scale of its application and analysed its accuracy and suitability for use in arid and semi-arid environments. A specific section is dedicated to advection. Finally, the specific problems of each method for correct use in the Mediterranean region are underlined. In conclusion, we focus attention on the most interesting new guidelines for research on the measurement and estimation of actual crop evapotranspiration. {\copyright} 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

In the present study, hydroponically grown Arabidopsis wild types (Col8 and Col0) and different suberin mutants with altered amounts and/or compositions (horst, esb1-1, and esb1-2) were used to test this hypothesis. Detailed histochemical studies revealed late development of Casparian bands and suberin lamellae in the horst mutant compared with wild types and esb mutants. Suberin analysis with gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS) showed that the horst mutant had ;33\% lower amounts of aliphatic monomers than Col8 and Col0. In contrast, enhanced suberin mutants (esb1-1 and esb1-2) had twice the amount of suberin as the wild types. Correlative permeability measurements, which were carried out for the first time with a root pressure probe for Arabidopsis, revealed that the hydraulic conductivity (Lpr) and NaCl permeability (Psr) of the whole root system of the horst mutant were markedly greater than in the respective wild types. This was reflected by the total amounts of aliphatic suberin determined in the roots. However, increased levels of aliphatic suberin in esb mutants failed to reduce either water or NaCl permeabilities below those of the wild types. It was concluded that the simple view and the conventional assumption that the amount of root suberin negatively correlates with permeability may not always be true. The aliphatic monomer arrangement in the suberin biopolymer and its microstructure also play a role in apoplastic barrier formation.},

ERT results translates to water content via empirical pedophysical relations that take soil physical properties into account, usually ignoring the impact of roots. Studies shows high root dense soils behaves quite differently than less root dense soils in terms of bulk electrical conductivity. Yet, we do not completely understand the impact of root segments on the ERT measurements. In this numerical study, we coupled an electrical model with a plant-soil water flow model to investigate the impact of plant root growth and water uptake on the ERT virtual experiment. The electrical properties of roots were explicitly accounted in the finite element mesh and we obtained the electrical conductivities of root segments by conducting specific experiments on real maize plants. The contrast between electrical conductivity of roots and soil depends on factors such as root density, irrigation, root age, and root water uptake pattern. Root growth and water uptake processes thus affect this contrast together with the soil electrical properties. Model results indicate a non-negligible anisotropy in bulk electrical conductivity induced by root processes. We see a greater anisotropy in a sandy medium when compared to a loamy medium. We find that the water uptake process dominates the bulk electrical properties. The Gauss-Newton type ERT inversion of virtual rhizotron data demonstrate that, when root-soil electrical conductivity contrasts are high, it can lead to error in water content estimates since the electrical conductivity is partly due to root. Thus, incorporating the impact of root in the pedophysical relations is very important to interpret ERT results directly as water content.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Considering the fact that reservoirs are complex fractured media which the fluid can flow through the porosities, the distribution model of oil in the medium needs to be investigated in detail and to be well quantified. To study this effect, a typical gamma-gamma logging tool containing               137               Cs source and two NaI detectors was modeled by using the MCNPX code. The medium was filled with numerous matrix-shaped blocks, each including rectangular cubes for modeling the oil flow in the formation. For an arbitrary set of oil concentrations and various formation materials, the response of the detectors for this model was studied. Taking into account the results corresponding to the traditional homogeneous mixture model for the formation, it was found that the deviations between the count rates for two models reach to about 10\% and 22\% for short spacing and far spacing detectors, respectively. The results also show that the slopes of the straight-line fits to the count rates, which is important for the evaluation of the density, deviate between about 73.3\% and 53.8\% for two simulated models. Investigating the effect of the presence of the drilling fluid on the count rate of the proposed model showed that for a given thickness of mudcake and the formation density, both detectors show approximately the same percentage of change in counting rate. However, these counts for the proposed model deviate from those of the mixture model between 5.1\% and 28\%.

  abstract = {Among the different techniques available, nuclear methods, including gamma-gamma logging tools, are of special importance. Though the real environment which surrounds the drilled borehole is a complex fractured medium which the fluid can flow through the porosities, simulation studies generally use the traditional model of a homogeneous mixture of formation and the liquid. Considering a previously published study, which shows that modeling of fluid flow in fractured reservoirs and simulating the formation as an inhomogeneous fractured medium leads to different results compared with those of homogeneous mixture, here we study the effect of the presence of drilling fluid (mudcake) on the response of the detectors in both the models. To study this effect, a typical gamma-gamma logging tool was modeled by using the MCNPX Monte Carlo code. The results show that the responses of the detectors in the mixture model in the presence of various thicknesses of mudcake are sensitive to the density of the formation material. However, this effect is not notable in the inhomogeneous fractured medium. These results emphasize the importance of the model employed for simulation of the medium in gamma-gamma well-logging.},

  abstract = {Reports about the relationship between soil water retention and organic carbon content are contradictory. We hypothesized that this relationship is affected by both proportions of textural components and amount of organic carbon. To test the hypothesis, we used the U.S. National Soil Characterization database and the database from pilot studies on soil quality as affected by long-term management. Regression trees and group method of data handling (GMDH) revealed a complex joint effect of texture and taxonomic order on water retention at 33 kPa. Adding information on taxonomic order and on taxonomic order and organic carbon content to the textural class brought 10\% and 20\% improvement in water retention estimation, respectively, as compared with estimation from the textural class alone. Using total clay, sand and silt along with organic carbon content and taxonomic order resulted in 25\% improvement in accuracy over using textural classes. Similar but lower trends in accuracy were found for water retention at 1500 kPa and the slope of the water retention curve. At low organic carbon contents, the sensitivity of the water retention to changes in organic matter content was highest in sandy soils. Increase in organic matter content led to increase of water retention in sandy soils, and to a decrease in fine-textured soils. At high organic carbon values, all soils showed an increase in water retention. The largest increase was in sandy and silty soils. Results are expressed as equations that can be used to evaluate effect of the carbon sequestration and management practices on soil hydraulic properties.},

  abstract = {A clear description of the mechanism of root cadmium absorption is required in order to understand how this toxic metal is phytoaccumulated. An experiment was carried out in order to test the hypotheses that (1) the Cd uptake is higher for maize roots grown in hydroponics than for those grown in aeroponics, (2) this difference is due to the fact that in aeroponics, root apoplastic barriers are developed more extensively than in hydroponics and (3) the structure of maize roots grown in aeroponics is closer to the structure of roots grown in soil. Apoplastic and symplastic cadmium uptake was measured by exposing the roots to a radio-labelled Cd solution and by the physical fractionation of the metal in the roots. Maturation of the exodermis and endodermis as well as their distance from the root tip were assessed through fluorescent staining and microscopy of successive sections along the main root. The results obtained support the initial hypotheses. Both symplastic absorption and apoplastic adsorption of Cd were higher for maize roots grown in hydroponics than in aeroponics. This can be explained by the fact that the beginning of the barrier formation took place on average at a distance of 12.46\% of the root length from its tip, while in aeroponics, root apoplastic barriers developed much earlier, at 2.72\% of the root length. Since the characteristics of maize plants roots cultivated in aeroponics were much closer to those cultivated in soil, their kinetic parameters may be considered to be more representative when measuring uptake than those of hydroponically grown plants.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Soil organic C (SOC) and soil moisture (SM) affect the agricultural productivity of soils. For sustainable food production, knowledge of the horizontal as well as vertical variability of SOC and SM at field scale is crucial. Machine learning models using depth-related data from multiple electromagnetic induction (EMI) sensors and a gamma-ray spectrometer can provide insights into this variability of SOC and SM. In this work, we applied weighted conditioned Latin hypercube sampling to calculate 25 representative soil profile locations based on geophysical measurements on the surveyed agricultural field, for sampling and modeling. Ten additional random profiles were used for independent model validation. Soil samples were taken from four equal depth increments of 15~cm each. These were used to approximate polynomial and exponential functions to reproduce the vertical trends of SOC and SM as soil depth functions. We modeled the function coefficients of the soil depth functions spatially with Cubist and random forests with the geophysical measurements as environmental covariates. The spatial prediction of the depth functions provides three-dimensional (3D) maps of the field scale. The main findings are (a) the 3D models of SOC and SM had low errors; (b) the polynomial function provided better results than the exponential function, as the vertical trends of SOC and SM did not decrease uniformly; and (c)~the spatial prediction of SOC and SM with Cubist provided slightly lower error than with random forests. Hence, we recommend modeling the second-degree polynomial with Cubist for 3D prediction of SOC and SM at field scale.           ,              Core Ideas                                                                                     Multi-depth EC                     a                     and gamma-ray spectrometry describe vertical trends of SOC and soil moisture.

  abstract = {We develop a new electrical conductivity equation based on Bussian's model and accounting for the different behavior of ions in the pore space. The tortuosity of the transport of anions is independent of the salinity and corresponds to the bulk tortuosity of the pore space which is given by the product of the electrical formation factor F and the porosity r/J. For the cations, the situation is different. At high salinities, the dominant paths for the electromigration of the cations are located in the interconnected pore space, and the tortuosity for the transport of cations is therefore the bulk tortuosity. As the salinity decreases, the dominant paths for transport of the cations shift from the pore space to the mineral water interface and consequently are subject to different tortuosities. This shift occurs at salinities e corresponding to I tf+i - 1, where.; is the ratio between the surface conductivity of the grains and the.electrolyte conductivity, and t(+J is the Hittorf transport number for cations in the electrolyte. The electrical conductivity of granular porous media is determined as a function of pore fluid salinity, temperature, water and gas saturations, shale content, and porosity. The model provides a very good explanation for the variation of electrical conductivity with these parameters. Surface conduction at the mineral water interface is described with the Stem theory of the electrical double layer and is shown to be independent of the salinity in shaly sands above 10-3 mol L - I . The model is applied to in Situ salinity determination in the Gulf Coast, and it provides realistic salinity profiles in agreement with sampled pore water. The results clearly demonstrate- the applicability of the equations to well log interpretation of shaly sands.},

  abstract = {The permeability of a sand shale mixture is analyzed as a function of shale fraction and the permeability of the two end-members, i.e., the permeability of a clay-free sand and the permeability of a pure shale. First, we develop a model for the permeability of a clay-free sand as a function of the grain diameter, the porosity, and the electrical cementation exponent. We show that the Kozeny-Carman-type relation can be improved by using electrical parameters which separate pore throat from total porosity and effective from total hydraulic radius. The permeability of a pure shale is derived in a similar way but is strongly dependent on clay mineralogy. For the same porosity, there are 5 orders of magnitude of difference between the permeability of pure kaolinite and the permeability of pure smectite. The separate end-members' permeability models are combined by filling the sand pores progressively with shale and then dispersing the sand grains in shale. The permeability of sand shale mixtures is shown to have a minimum at the critical shale content at which shale just fills the sand pores. Pure shale has a slightly higher permeability. Permeability decreases sharply with shale content as the pores of a sand are filled. The permeability of sand shale mixtures thus has a very strong dependence on shale fraction, and available data confirm this distinctive shale-fraction dependence. In addition, there is agreement (within 1 order of magnitude) between the permeabilities predicted from our model and those measured over 11 orders of magnitude from literature sources. Finally, we apply our model to predict the permeabilities of shaly sand formations in the Gulf Coast. The predictions are compared to a data set of permeability determination made on side-wall cores. The agreement between the theoretical predictions and the experimental data is very good.},

  abstract = {In a salinity gradient, the diffusion of ions through the connected porosity of a porous and charged material is influenced by the charged nature of the interface between the pore water and the solid. This influence is exerted through the generation of a macroscopic electrical field termed the diffusion or membrane potential. This electrical field depends on the excess of counterions located in the pore space counterbalancing the charge density of the surface of the solid. In unsaturated porous materials, we have to consider (1) the effect of the charged nature of the air/water interface, (2) the increase of the counterion density as the counterions are packed in a smaller volume when the saturation of the nonwetting phase (air) increases, and (3) the influence of the water saturation upon the tortuosity of the water phase. The volume average of the Nernst--Planck equation is used to determine the constitutive equations for the coupled diffusion flux and current density of a multicomponent electrolyte in unsaturated conditions. We assume that water is the wetting phase for the solid phase. We neglect the electro-osmotic flow in the coupled constitutive equations and the deformation of the medium (the medium is assumed to be both isotropic and rigid). This model explains well the observed tendency of strong decreases of the apparent diffusion coefficient of ions with the decrease of the saturation of the water phase under steady-state conditions. This decrease is mainly due to the influence of the saturation upon the tortuosity of the water phase.},

  abstract = {The surface conductivity of porous rocks has two contributions: the first is associated with the diffuse layer coating the grains and is frequency-independent as long as the diffuse layer is above a percolation threshold. The second contribution is associated with the Stern layer of weakly sorbed counterions on the mineral surface and is frequency-dependent if the Stern layer is discontinuous at the scale of the representative elementary volume. In the frequency range 1 mHz--100 Hz, this second contribution is also associated with the main polarization mechanism observed by the spectral induced polarization method in granular media (neglecting the contribution of other polarization processes like those associated with redox processes and membrane polarization). At the macroscale, we connect the Stern layer contribution to the complex conductivity and to the expectation of the probability distribution of the inverse of the grain size. This is done by performing a convolution between the probability distribution of the inverse of the grain size and the surface conductivity response obtained when all the grains have the same size. Surface conductivity at the macroscopic scale is also connected to an effective pore size used to characterize permeability. From these relationships, a new equation is derived connecting this effective pore size, the electrical formation factor, and the expected value of the probability distribution for the inverse of the grain size, which is in turn related to the distribution of the relaxation times. These new relationships are consistent with various formula derived in the literature in the limit where the grain size distribution is given by the delta function or a log normal distribution and agree fairly well with various experimental data showing also some limitations of the induced polarization method to infer permeability. One of these limitations is the difficulty to detect the relaxation, in the phase, associated with the smaller grains, as this polarization may be hidden by the Maxwell--Wagner polarization at relatively high frequencies ({$>$}100 Hz). Also, cemented aggregates of grains can behave as coarser grains.},

  abstract = {In electrolyte-saturated sands, the reversible storage of electrical charges is responsible for a phase lag between the current (injected and retrieved by two current electrodes) and the electrical field recorded by two voltage electrodes. This phenomenon is called `spectral induced polarization' in geophysics and can potentially be used to monitor salt tracer tests in shallow aquifers to infer their permeability and dispersivity tensors. We demonstrate analytically that the polarization of the inner part of the electrical triple layer coating the surface of the grains (named the Stern layer in electrochemistry) is consistent with available data. We also perform new experiments using silica sands saturated by NaCl and CaCl2 pore water solutions. The salinity dependence of quadrature conductivity can be modelled using an analytical solution of the triple layer model, which offers a simple way to interpret laboratory and field data. This analytical solution depends on the total site density of the mineral surface, the pH value and the sorption coefficient of the cation in the Stern layer. This model shows that both the specific surface conductivity of the Stern layer and the quadrature conductivity of the porous material depend on the conductivity of the pore water. The quadrature conductivity is becoming independent of the salinity above 1 S m-1. The parameters entering the analytical model are consistent with independent estimates from titration data and zeta potential measurements, which are two classical methods to characterize the electrical triple layer at the pore water mineral interface.},

  abstract = {The complex conductivity of porous materials and colloidal suspensions comprises two components: an in-phase conductivity associated with electromigration of the charge carriers and a quadrature conductivity associated with the reversible storage of the charges at some polarization length scales. We developed a quantitative model to investigate the frequency domain induced polarization response of suspensions of bacteria and bacteria growth in porous media. Induced polarization of bacteria (               {$\alpha$}               polarization) is related to the properties of the electrical double layer of the bacteria. Surface conductivity and               {$\alpha$}               polarization are due to the Stern layer of counterions occurring in a brush of polymers coating the surface of the bacteria. These phenomena can be related to their cation exchange capacity. The mobility of the counterions in this Stern layer is found to be very small (4.7~{\texttimes}~10               -10               m               2               s               -1               V               -1               at 25{$^\circ$}C). This implies a very low relaxation frequency for the               {$\alpha$}               polarization of the bacteria cells (typically around 0.1--5 Hz), in agreement with experimental observations. This new model can be coupled to reactive transport modeling codes in which the evolution of bacterial populations are usually described by Monod kinetics. We show that the growth rate and endogenous decay coefficients of bacteria in a porous sand can be inferred nonintrusively from time-lapse frequency domain induced polarization data.                        ,              Key Points                                                                The polarization of bacteria has a distinctive macroscopic electrical signature                                                     Induced polarization can be used to assess Monod kinetics parameters                                                     This assessment is non-intrusive},

We have compared various predictions of this model to a broad set of experimental data. The chargeability was found to be controlled only by the volume fraction of metallic particles in agreement with the experimental data. The relaxation time, defined from the peak frequency of the phase, was observed to be proportional to the square of the size of the metallic particles and was independent of the salinity of the pore water solution. The relationship between the peak frequency and the grain size could be used to determine the diffusion coefficient of the [Formula: see text]- and [Formula: see text]-charge carriers in the semiconductor. This diffusion coefficient was consistent with the mobility of the charge carriers derived from theoretical considerations or electric-conductivity measurements. The resistivity of a mixture of a porous matrix characterized by a low-chargeability and dispersed semiconductors does not depend on the content of metallic grains, as long as the grains are below a percolation threshold ({$<~$}22~vol.\%). Various experiments were performed using magnetite and pyrite at different grain sizes, weight fractions, and with/without porous materials (i.e., suspended in agar gel). These data were used to test some additional aspects of the model. We found excellent agreement between the model predictions and these experimental data.},

  abstract = {A model is proposed regarding the polarization of dispersed metallic conductors (e.g., pyrite and magnetite) in porous media free of redox-active ionic species in the pore water. We studied two cases corresponding to having a background material with or without chargeability. The model was based on the polarization mechanism of a single particle using well-established bounds for the reflection coefficient entering the definition of the dipole moment of the metallic grains. We used the Maxwell-Clausius-Mossotti mixing equation to obtain the complex conductivity of the mixture of dispersed metallic particles in the background porous material composed of the pore water and the insulating grains coated by an electric double-layer. This equation can be generalized to a mixture of various types of metallic particles (with their own properties) dispersed in the background porous material. Our model led to a very simple linear relationship between the chargeability and the volume content of metallic particles in the material. In addition, the chargeability depended weakly only on the shape of the spheroidal metallic particles as long as their orientation was random. The relaxation time defined from the phase peak frequency related to the diffusion coefficient of the [Formula: see text]- and [Formula: see text]-charge carriers in the metallic particles. This diffusion coefficient was consistent with the mobility of the charge carriers derived from theoretical considerations or electric conductivity measurements. In the presence of a polarizable background (e.g., a clayey matrix), we found that the total chargeability of the material can be determined from the chargeability of the metallic particles and the chargeability of the background material.},

  abstract = {Low-frequency quadrature conductivity spectra of siliclastic materials exhibit typically a characteristic relaxation time, which either corresponds to the peak frequency of the phase or the quadrature conductivity or a typical corner frequency, at which the quadrature conductivity starts to decrease rapidly toward lower frequencies. This characteristic relaxation time can be combined with the (intrinsic) formation factor and a diffusion coefficient to predict the permeability to flow of porous materials at saturation. The intrinsic formation factor can either be determined at several salinities using an electrical conductivity model or at a single salinity using a relationship between the surface and quadrature conductivities. The diffusion coefficient entering into the relationship between the permeability, the characteristic relaxation time, and the formation factor takes only two distinct values for isothermal conditions. For pure silica, the diffusion coefficient of cations, like sodium or potassium, in the Stern layer is equal to the diffusion coefficient of these ions in the bulk pore water, indicating weak sorption of these couterions. For clayey materials and clean sands and sandstones whose surface have been exposed to alumina (possibly iron), the diffusion coefficient of the cations in the Stern layer appears to be 350 times smaller than the diffusion coefficient of the same cations in the pore water. These values are consistent with the values of the ionic mobilities used to determine the amplitude of the low and high-frequency quadrature conductivities and surface conductivity. The database used to test the model comprises a total of 202 samples. Our analysis reveals that permeability prediction with the proposed model is usually within an order of magnitude from the measured value above 0.1 mD. We also discuss the relationship between the different time constants that have been considered in previous works as characteristic relaxation time, including the mean relaxation time obtained from a Debye decomposition of the spectra and the Cole-Cole time constant.},

The initial pore water conductivity was either 1500 or [Formula: see text] depending on the experiments (25{$^\circ$}C, NaCl). For each of the 15 experiments, we used a narrow and unimodal grain size distribution for the metallic particles. The resulting polarization spectra display clear polarization peaks in the phase and can be fitted with a Cole-Cole complex conductivity model. In addition to this, the chargeability scales with the volume content of the metallic particles in a way that is consistent with the theory of disseminated metallic particles in a weakly polarizable background. Similarly, the phase scales with the content of the metallic particles in a predictable way. The Cole-Cole relaxation time shows a rough dependence with the mean particle size. The trend between these two parameters can be used to determine an apparent diffusion coefficient for the charge carriers responsible for the polarization. Finally, we conducted a laboratory sandbox experiment in which we put a copper plate in tap water-saturated sand. We use an approach based on self-potential tomography and compactness to invert the secondary source current density from the secondary voltages associated with time-domain induced polarization. With this approach, we localized the copper plate and determined a value for the relaxation time that is consistent with the laboratory core sample experiments.},

  abstract = {Disseminated ores in porous or fractured media can be polarized under the application of an external low-frequency electrical field. This polarization is characterized by a dimensionless property that is called the ``chargeability''. Induced polarization is a nonintrusive geophysical sensing technique that be used in the field to image both the electrical conductivity and the chargeability of porous rocks together with a characteristic relaxation time. A petrophysical model of the induced polarization of metallic ores immersed in a porous conductive and polarizable material is reviewed, and its predictions are compared to a large dataset of experimental data. The model shows that the chargeability of the material is linearly dependent on the volume fraction of the ore and the chargeability of the background material, which can, in turn, be related to the conductivity of the pore water and the cation exchange capacity of the clay fraction. The relaxation time depends on the grain sizes of the ores and on the conductivity of the background material, which is close to the conductivity of the porous rock itself. Five applications of the induced-polarization method to ore and metallic bodies are discussed in order to show the usefulness of this technique. These applications include: (i) A sandbox experiment, in which cubes of pyrite are located in a specific area of the tank; (ii) The tomography of an iron slag at an archeological site in France; (iii) A study of partially frozen graphitic schists in the French Alps; (iv) The detection of a metallic tank through the tomography of the relaxation times; and (v) The detection and localization of a deep ore body that is associated with a tectonic fault. We also discuss the possibility of combining self-potential and induced-polarization tomography to better characterize ore bodies below the seafloor.},

Wecollected undisturbed cores of four soil types (fsl, vfsl, 1, cl) using Lucite column inserts, which were tapped for later insertion of electrodes. The cells were equilibrated with waters of a desired EC and, using a pressure membrane apparatus, adjusted to a desired 6, Values of ECa were calculated for each ECu, - 8 equilibration from measured four-electrode resistances and an appropriate cell constant. Our results indicated that over the 0-range of practical concern, ECa = (transmission coefficient) x e x EC,,, + surface conductivity. This relationship is derived using a simple capillary model, which assumes that liquid phase and surface conductivities (via exchangeable cations) behave as resistors in parallel.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Investigating the flow behavior in microfluidic systems has become of interest due to the need for precise control of the mass and momentum transport in microfluidic devices. In multilayered-flows, precise control of the flow behavior requires a more thorough understanding as it depends on multiple parameters. The following paper proposes a microfluidic system consisting of an aqueous solution between a moving plate and a stationary wall, where the moving plate mimics a charged oil--water interface. Analytical expressions are derived by solving the nonlinear Poisson--Boltzmann equation along with the simplified Navier--Stokes equation to describe the electrokinetic effects on the shear-driven flow of the aqueous electrolyte solution. The Debye--Huckel approximation is not employed in the derivation extending its compatibility to high interfacial zeta potential. Additionally, a numerical model is developed to predict the streaming potential flow created due to the shear-driven motion of the charged upper wall along with its associated electric double layer effect. The model utilizes the extended Nernst--Planck equations instead of the linearized Poisson--Boltzmann equation to accurately predict the axial variation in ion concentration along the microchannel. Results show that the interfacial zeta potential of the moving interface greatly impacts the velocity profile of the flow and can reverse its overall direction. The numerical results are validated by the analytical expressions, where both models predicted that flow could reverse its overall direction when the interfacial zeta potential of the oil--water is above a certain threshold value. Finally, this paper describes the electroviscous effect as well as the transient development of electrokinetic effects within the microchannel.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Non-rainfall water (NRW), defined here as dew, hoar frost, fog, rime, and water vapour adsorption, might be a relevant water source for ecosystems, especially during summer drought periods. These water inputs are often not considered in ecohydrological studies, because water amounts of NRW events are rather small and therefore difficult to measure. Here we present a novel micro-lysimeter (ML) system and its application which allows us to quantify very small water inputs from NRW during rain-free periods with an unprecedented high accuracy of {\textpm}0.25\,g, which corresponds to {\textpm}0.005\,mm water input. This is possible with an improved ML design paired with individual ML calibrations in combination with high-frequency measurements at 3.3\,Hz and an efficient low-pass filtering to reduce noise level. With a set of ancillary sensors, the ML system furthermore allows differentiation between different types of NRW inputs, i.e. dew, hoar frost, fog, rime, and the combinations among these, but also additional events when condensation on leaves is less probable, such as water vapour adsorption events. In addition, our ML system design allows one to minimize deviations from natural conditions in terms of canopy and soil temperatures, plant growth, and soil moisture. This is found to be a crucial aspect for obtaining realistic NRW measurements in short-statured grasslands. Soil temperatures were higher in the ML compared to the control, and thus further studies should focus on improving the thermal soil regime of ML. Our ML system has proven to be useful for high-accuracy, long-term measurements of NRW on short-statured vegetation-like grasslands. Measurements with the ML system at a field site in Switzerland showed that NRW input occurred frequently, with 127 events over 12 months with a total NRW input of 15.9\,mm. Drainage-water flow of the ML was not measured, and therefore the NRW inputs might be conservative estimates. High average monthly NRW inputs were measured during summer months, suggesting a high ecohydrological relevance of NRW inputs for temperate grasslands.},

As a matter of fact, the available cable length generally imposes a poor approximation of theoretical location of these electrodes at infinity. This study shows that in most of the cases, the resulting apparent resistivity pseudosection is strongly distorted. Numerical simulation validated by field test also shows that a particular finite array provides results that are as close as possible to the ones of the ideal pole--pole array. This is achieved when two conditions that are weaker than an infinite location are fulfilled: {\v Z}i. the `infinite electrodes' are placed symmetrically on both sides of the in-line electrodes with a spread angle of 308 and {\v Z}ii. the length of `infinite lines' is at least 20 times the greatest distance between in-line electrodes. The electrical 2D image obtained with this enhanced array is the least distorted one with respect to the pole--pole image. The apparent resistivities are generally underestimated, but this deviation is almost homogeneous. Though the shift cannot be determined a priori, the interpretation of such an image with direct or inverse software designed for pole--pole data provides an accurate interpretation of the ground geometry. q 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

We identify recent advances in geophysical instrumentation, and provide a vision for the use of electrical and magnetic geophysical instrumentation in watershed scale hydrology. The focus of the paper is to identify instrumentation that could significantly advance this vision for geophysics and hydrology during the next 3--5 years. We acknowledge that this is one of a number of possible ways forward and seek only to offer a relatively narrow and achievable vision. The vision focuses on the measurement of geological structure and identification of flow paths using electrical and magnetic methods. The paper identifies instruments, provides examples of their use, and describes how synergy between measurement and modelling could be achieved. Of specific interest are the airborne systems that can cover large areas and are appropriate for watershed studies. Although airborne geophysics has been around for some time, only in the last few years have systems designed exclusively for hydrological applications begun to emerge. These systems, such as airborne electromagnetic (EM) and transient electromagnetic (TEM), could revolutionize hydrogeological interpretations. Our vision centers on developing nested and cross scale electrical and magnetic measurements that can be used to construct a three-dimensional (3D) electrical or magnetic model of the subsurface in watersheds. The methodological framework assumes a `top down' approach using airborne methods to identify the large scale, dominant architecture of the subsurface. We recognize that the integration of geophysical measurement methods, and data, into watershed process characterization and modelling can only be achieved through dialogue. Especially, through the development of partnerships between geophysicists and hydrologists, partnerships that explore how the application of geophysics can answer critical hydrological science questions, and conversely provide an understanding of the limitations of geophysical measurements and interpretation.

  abstract = {Abstract             The growing interest in the maintenance of favorable soil structure is largely motivated by its central role in plant growth, soil ecological functioning, and impacts on surface water and energy fluxes. Soil structure pertains to the spatial arrangement of voids and solid constituents, their aggregation, and mechanical state. As a fragile product of soil biological activity that includes invisible ingredients (mechanical and ecological states), soil structure is difficult to define rigorously, and measurements of relevant metrics often rely on core samples or on episodic point measurements. The presence of soil structure has not yet been explicitly incorporated in climate and Earth systems models, partially due to incomplete methodological means to characterize it at relevant scales and to parameterize it in spatially extensive models. We seek to review the potential of harnessing geophysical methods to fill the scale gap in characterization of soil structure directly (via impact of soil pores, transport, and mechanical properties on geophysical signals) or indirectly by measurement of surrogate variables (wetness and rates of drainage). We review basic aspects of soil structure and challenges of characterization across spatial and temporal scales and how geophysical methods could be used for the task. Additionally, we propose the use of geophysical models, inversion techniques, and combination of geophysical methods for extracting soil structure information at previously unexplored spatial and temporal scales.           ,              Key Points                                                                Geophysical methods offer new opportunities for soil structure characterization at larger spatial and temporal scales                                                     Combinations of geophysical methods expand the range of quantifiable soil structural attributes from pores to mechanical properties                                                     Geophysical methods can capitalize on surrogate dynamic hydrological variables as integrative indicators for soil structure at field scales},

  abstract = {Abstract             Soil compaction is a regarded as a major environmental and economical hazard, degrading soils across the world. Changes in soil properties due to compaction are known to lead to decrease in biomass and increase in greenhouse gas emissions, nutrient leaching and soil erosion. Quantifying adverse impacts of soil compaction and developing strategies for amelioration relies on an understanding of soil compaction extent and temporal variability. The main indicators of soil compaction (i.e., reduction of pore space, increase in bulk density and decrease in soil transport properties) are relatively easy to quantify in laboratory conditions but such traditional point-based methods offer little information on soil compaction extent~at the field scale. Recently, geophysical methods have been proposed to provide non-invasive information about soil compaction. In this work, we developed an agrogeophysical modelling framework to help address the challenges of characterizing soil compaction across grazing paddocks using electromagnetic induction (EMI) data. By integrative modelling of grazing, soil compaction, soil processes and EMI resistivity anomalies, we demonstrate how spatial patterns of EMI observations can be linked to management leading to soil compaction and concurrent modifications of soil functions. The model was tested in a dairy farm in the midlands of Ireland that has been grazed for decades and shows clear signatures of grazing-induced compaction. EMI data were collected in the summer of 2021 and autumn of 2022 under dry and wet soil moisture conditions, respectively. For both years, we observed decreases of apparent electrical resistivity at locations that with visible signatures of compaction such as decreased vegetation and water ponding (e.g., near the water troughs and gates). A machine learning algorithm was used to cluster EMI data with three unique cluster signatures assumed to be representative of heavy, moderately, and non-compacted field zones. We conducted 1D process-based simulations corresponding to non-compacted and compacted soils. The modelled EMI signatures agree qualitatively and quantitatively with the measured EMI data, linking decreased electrical resistivities to zones that were visibly compacted. By providing a theoretical framework based on mechanistic modelling of soil management and compaction, our work may provide a strategy for utilizing EMI data for detection of soil degradation due to compaction.},

The quantitative relations of {$\rho$} and root biometry and the contribution of different root size classes were investigated with two- and three-dimensional 48-electrode tomograms in an orchard in southern Italy on a Typic haploxeralf fine, mixed termic soil. Root biomass density (RD) and root length density (RLD) were measured destructively on coarse ({$>$}2 mm diameter) and fine roots, and soil paste electrical conductivity, water content, stone content, texture, organic matter and pH were measured on soil samples taken up to 0.48-m deep. Areas of large {$\rho$} values (up to 460 ohm m) were found close to tree trunks and variability in {$\rho$} was related to RD (0--0.137 Mg m-3) only; the resistive response was from coarse roots. The effect of other soil variables on {$\rho$} was overshadowed by the presence of roots and therefore no significant multivariate relationship was found. A highly significant {$\rho$}-RD gamma GLM model used to fit positively skewed data provides a useful framework for regression analysis when {$\rho$} is dominated by roots. Soil electrical resistivity is promising as a proxy for RD in orchards, but not for RLD, and the effect of tree roots on {$\rho$} needs to be taken into account in electrical surveys of soils.},

  abstract = {Geophysical surveys can provide useful, albeit indirect, information on vadose zone processes. However, the ability to provide a quantitative description of the subsurface hydrological phenomena requires to fully integrate geophysical data into hydrological modeling. Here, we describe a controlled infiltration experiment that was monitored using both electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and ground-penetrating radar (GPR). The experimental site has a simple, well-characterized subsoil structure: the vadose zone is composed of aeolic sand with largely homogeneous and isotropic properties. In order to estimate the unknown soil hydraulic conductivity, we apply a data assimilation technique based on a sequential importance resampling (SIR) approach. The SIR approach allows a simple assimilation of either or both geophysical datasets taking into account the associated measurement uncertainties. We demonstrate that, compared to a simpler, uncoupled hydro-geophysical approach, the coupled data assimilation process provides a more reliable parameter estimation and better reproduces the evolution of the infiltrating water plume. The coupled procedure is indeed much superior to the uncoupled approach that suffers from the artifacts of the geophysical inversion step and produces severe mass balance errors. The combined assimilation of GPR and ERT data is then investigated, highlighting strengths and weaknesses of the two datasets. In the case at hand GPR energy propagates in form of a guided wave that, over time, shows different energy distribution between propagation modes as a consequence of the evolving thickness of the wet layer. We found that the GPR inversion procedure may produce estimates on the depth of the infiltrating front that are not as informative as the ERT dataset.},

Three small excavations revealed, approximately one meter below the current surface and covered by alluvial sediments, a rather complex palimpsest dated to the late Recent and the early Final Bronze Age. Three large circular pits containing exclusively purified grey/blue clay and very rare inclusions of vegetable fibres, and many large, fired clay vessels' bases, walls and rims clustered in concentrated assemblages and random deposits point to potential on-site production. Two pyro-technological structures, one characterised by a sub-circular combustion chamber and a long inlet channel/praefurnium, and the second one with a sub-rectangular shape with arched niches along its southern side, complete the exceptional context here discovered. To analyse the relationship between the site and the natural sedimentary succession and to evaluate the possible extension of this site, three electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and low-frequency electromagnetic (FDEM) measurements were collected. Several manual core drillings associated with remote sensing integrated the geophysical data in the analysis of the geomorphological evolution of this area, clearly related to different phases of fluvial activity, in a framework of continuous relative sea level rise. The typology and chronology of the archaeological structures and materials, currently undergoing further analyses, support the interpretation of the site as a late Recent/early Final Bronze Age productive site. Geophysical and geomorphological data provide information on the palaeoenvironmental setting, suggesting that the site was located on a fine-grained, stable alluvial plain at a distance of a few kilometres from the lagoon shore to the south-east and the course of the Brenta River to the north. The archaeological site was buried by fine-grained floodplain deposits attributed to the Brenta River. The good preservation of the archaeological structures buried by fluvial sediments suggests that the site was abandoned soon before sedimentation started.},

The present contribution reviews published material on the Riviera Valley's boundary layer structure and discusses new material on the near-surface turbulence structure. The general conclusion of the project is that despite the large spatial variability of turbulence characteristics and the crucial influence of topography at all scales, the physical processes can accurately be understood and modelled. Nevertheless, many of the ``text book characteristics'' like the interaction between the valley and slope wind systems or the erosion of the nocturnal valley inversion need reconsideration, at least for small non-ideal valleys like the Riviera Valley. The project has identified new areas of research such as post-processing methods for turbulence variables in complex terrain and new approaches for the surface energy balance when advection is non-negligible. The exchange of moisture and heat between the valley atmosphere and the free troposphere is dominated by local ``secondary'' circulations due to the curvature of the valley axis. Because many curved valleys exist, and operational models still have rather poor resolution, parameterization of these processes may be required.},

  author = {Routh, Partha S and Oldenburg, Douglas W},
  year = {2001},
  pages = {18},
  abstract = {Electromagnetic (EM) coupling is generally considered to be noise in induced polarization (IP) data and interpretation is difficult when its contribution is large compared to the IP signal. The effect is exacerbated by conductive environments and large-array survey geometries designed to explore deeper targets. In this paper we present a methodology to remove EM coupling from frequency-domain IP data. We first investigate the effect of EM coupling on the IP data and derive the necessary equations to represent the IP effect for both amplitude and phase responses of the signal. The separation of the inductive response from the total response in the low-frequency regime is derived using the electric field due to a horizontal electric dipole and it is assumed that at low frequencies the interaction of EM effects and IP effects is negligible. The total electric field is then expressed as a product of a scalar function, which is due to IP effects, and an electric field, which depends on the EM coupling response. It is this representation that enables us to obtain the IP response from EM-coupling-contaminated data. To compute the EM coupling response we recognize that conductivity information is necessary. We illustrate this with a synthetic example. The removal method developed in this work for the phase and the per cent frequency effect (PFE) data are applicable to 1-D, 2-D and 3-D structures. The practical utility of the method is illustrated on a 2-D field example that is typical of mineral exploration problems.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Ecosystems integrity and services are threatened by anthropogenic global changes. Mitigating and adapting to these changes require knowledge of ecosystem functioning in the expected novel environments, informed in large part through experimentation and modelling. This paper describes 13 advanced controlled environment facilities for experimental ecosystem studies, herein termed ecotrons, open to the international community. Ecotrons enable simulation of a wide range of natural environmental conditions in replicated and independent experimental units while measuring various ecosystem processes. This capacity to realistically control ecosystem environments is used to emulate a variety of climatic scenarios and soil conditions, in natural sunlight or through broad-spectrum lighting. The use of large ecosystem samples, intact or reconstructed, minimizes border effects and increases biological and physical complexity. Measurements of concentrations of greenhouse trace gases as well as their net exchange between the ecosystem and the atmosphere are performed in most ecotrons, often quasi continuously. The flow of matter is often tracked with the use of stable isotope tracers of carbon and other elements. Equipment is available for measurements of soil water status as well as root and canopy growth. The experiments ran so far emphasize the diversity of the hosted research. Half of them concern global changes, often with a manipulation of more than one driver. About a quarter deal with the impact of biodiversity loss on ecosystem functioning and one quarter with ecosystem or plant physiology. We discuss how the methodology for environmental simulation and process measurements, especially in soil, can be improved and stress the need to establish stronger links with modelling in future projects. These developments will enable further improvements in mechanistic understanding and predictive capacity of ecotron research which will play, in complementarity with field experimentation and monitoring, a crucial role in exploring the ecosystem consequences of environmental changes.},

The crucial innovation is, firstly, the incorporation of unstructured tetrahedral meshes, which allow for efficient local mesh refinement and most flexible description of arbitrary model geometry. Secondly, by implementation of quadratic shape functions we achieve considerably more accurate results. Exploiting a secondary potential (SP) approach, meshes are downsized significantly in comparison with highly refined meshes for total potential calculation. However, the latter is necessary for the determination of the required primary potential in arbitrary model domains. To start with, we concentrate on the simulation of homogeneous models with different geometries at the surface and subsurface to quantify their influence. This results in a so-called geometry effect, which is not only a side effect but may be responsible for serious misinterpretations. Moreover, it represents the basis for treating heterogeneous conductivity models with the SP approach, which is especially promising for the inverse problem.},

  abstract = {Direct-current resistivity surveys usually are performed using steel rods of finite extent and grounding resistance. However, in modeling, electrodes are commonly treated as ideal point sources. We present an approach for numerical computation applying the complete electrode model (CEM), which is known from medical imaging. The electrode surface was discretized, and the partial-differential equations were extended by additional relations incorporating a contact impedance and a condition for the current flow through the electrode surface. We verified the modeling of the electrical potential using an analytical solution for a perfectly coupled half-ellipsoid current source. To quantify the influence of a finite electrode, we computed the electrode effect as the ratio between CEM and point-source solution and investigated its dependence on geometry and contact impedance. Surface measurements using rods of typical spatial extent showed electrode effects on the order of the measuring accuracy for an electrode length/spacing ratio lower than 0.2. However, the effects are more significant for closed geometries such as experimental tanks. A comparison with a point approximation for finite electrodes using point-source locations along the electrode axis showed the best agreement, with points at about 60\% of the electrode extension. The contact impedance played a minor role for four-point measurements, contributing only a few percent to the electrode effect. In addition to penetrating electrodes, we investigated surface electrodes with galvanic or capacitive coupling, showing electrode effects on the same order as for penetrating electrodes. An inhomogeneous resistivity distribution clearly increased the size of the effects. We also investigate the use of CEM to simulate current injected through steel-cased boreholes. Finally, we applied the approach with buried ring electrodes to calculate effects caused mainly by geometric disturbances from the borehole.},

  abstract = {Many tasks in applied geosciences cannot be solved by single measurements, but require the integration of geophysical, geotechnical and hydrological methods. Numerical simulation techniques are essential both for planning and interpretation, as well as for the process understanding of modern geophysical methods. These trends encourage open, simple, and modern software architectures aiming at a uniform interface for interdisciplinary and flexible modelling and inversion approaches. We present pyGIMLi (Python Library for Inversion and Modelling in Geophysics), an open-source framework that provides tools for modelling and inversion of various geophysical but also hydrological methods. The modelling component supplies discretization management and the numerical basis for finite-element and finitevolume solvers in 1D, 2D and 3D on arbitrarily structured meshes. The generalized inversion framework solves the minimization problem with a Gauss-Newton algorithm for any physical forward operator and provides opportunities for uncertainty and resolution analyses. More general requirements, such as flexible regularization strategies, time-lapse processing and different sorts of coupling individual methods are provided independently of the actual methods used. The usage of pyGIMLi is first demonstrated by solving the steady-state heat equation, followed by a demonstration of more complex capabilities for the combination of different geophysical data sets. A fully coupled hydrogeophysical inversion of electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) data of a simulated tracer experiment is presented that allows to directly reconstruct the underlying hydraulic conductivity distribution of the aquifer. Another example demonstrates the improvement of jointly inverting ERT and ultrasonic data with respect to saturation by a new approach that incorporates petrophysical relations in the inversion. Potential applications of the presented framework are manifold and include time-lapse, constrained, joint, and coupled inversions of various geophysical and hydrological data sets.},

Weighing lysimeters are a well-established means of accurately obtaining local-scale estimates of actual evapotranspiration (ET), precipitation, and seepage within soils. At the Rietholzbach research catchment in northeastern Switzerland, two weighing lysimeters are in operation. One is a recently installed state-of-the-art monolithic mini-lysimeter with a tension-controlled lower boundary; the other is a large backfilled free-drainage lysimeter in operation since 1976. For this study, the mini-lysimeter measurements were processed using the Adaptive-Window and Adaptive-Threshold (AWAT) filter. The resulting water-balance estimates were then compared with those of the lower resolution large lysimeter, whose processing has remained unchanged since its installation. A number of additional, retrospectively applicable processing steps for the large lysimeter were then tested to mitigate the main sources of error for this instrument. Those found to be most beneficial were the application of a 10-min moving average to the mass measurements and the setting of ET and condensation to zero in hours with liquid precipitation. In spite of the differences in design, a generally close agreement between the two lysimeters was observed, which was further improved with the optimized large-lysimeter processing. A comparison of the lysimeter mass increases associated with liquid precipitation further revealed, however, that the large lysimeter experiences a previously unknown under-catch of about 11.5\%, which could also be important for other lysimeter facilities. This under-catch led to a reduction in large-lysimeter seepage during the analyzed period, although the ET flux was not found to be affected.},

This information may be used to improve management practices in order to maintain not only environmental sustainability but also the standards of milk production. The aim was to test the performance of electrical resistivity tomography to detect anomalies of resistivity and to identify the relative impact, on physicochemical properties of soil and groundwater, produced by the effluents of the different management units of a dairy farm situated in the southern part of Santa Fe Province (Argentina). Twelve electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) profiles were carried out and 2D models of the resistivity distribution were interpreted together with the physicochemical analysis of soil and groundwater samples. At the plots around the milking house, resistivity decreased in the non-saturated zone between 60--84\% relative to the background values, being the maximum value for the feeding zone, the most critical management unit, in agreement with sampling results. The surroundings of the lagoon of effluents showed a decrease of resistivity around 80\%, even on the phreatic aquifer, due to flooding events in the past. Electrical resistivity tomography was sensitive enough to evaluate anomalies in the distribution of electrical conductivity associated with an increase of nitrates, sulphates and bicarbonates, in addition to phosphorous in soil and chlorides in groundwater, in all cases probably connected directly or indirectly with the animal waste.},

  abstract = {In this study, the adaptation characteristics of orange trees, related to the application over a decade of deficit irrigation (DI) strategies, have been explored. To this purpose, the analysis of a minimal dataset composed of physiological information (stem water potential - {$\Psi$}stem and sap flow - SF measurements), yield (fruits number and weight) and qualitative parameters (titratable acidity, TA; and total soluble solids, TSS) was performed with reference to the last irrigation seasons (i.e. 2018--19). The applied irrigation treatments were the following: sustained deficit irrigation (SDI); regulated deficit irrigation (RDI); partial root-zone drying (PRD), each distributing a water deficit of about 19\%, 29\% and 52\%, respectively, compared to the control treatment (FI) supplying the full irrigation level (100\% ETc). In general, higher water use efficiencies (WUE) have been obtained in DI treatments, which guarantee greater water savings (up to 50\%), without affecting yield and quality characteristics. In particular, the most stressed treatment (PRD), while reaching the lowest {$\Psi$}stem values ( 1.8 to 2.0 MPa), as also shown by SF versus {$\Psi$}stem clusters, resulted in WUE values for yield (WUEY), TA (WUETA) and TSS (WUETSS) parameters of approximately 2.6, 2.9, and 3.1 times greater than FI, respectively. Overall, this study allowed identifying the cumulative adaptation characteristics of the orange trees under study to the application of long-term DI strategies and showing that trees were able to achieve yields and qualitative features similar to those obtained with FI, even after 10 years of application of deficient irrigation regimes.},

  abstract = {An experimental and theoretical investigation of the scaling laws governing the phenomenon of Maxwell-Wagner-Sillars interfacial polarization in composite materials in dependence on morphology, volume fraction, orientation of fillers, form factor and presence of interphases is presented in the current study. By considering the complex dielectric function of the matrix and of the fillers, the dielectric spectra are calculated in the frequency range from 107 Hz to 10-2 Hz and compared to dielectric measurements by Broadband Dielectric Spectroscopy, carried out in the frequency range from 107 Hz to 0.5 Hz and between -90 oC and 150 oC. The characteristic frequencies of the global dielectric response are reported to strongly vary with the conductivity value of the conductive phase, while a much weaker dependence is observed upon varying the volume fraction, the form factor and the orientation of fillers. The value of permittivity at low frequency does not change with the conductivity value, whereas a significant variation is observed in dependence on the composite morphology, form factor, orientation of fillers and presence of interfaces with different gradients of properties. Two possible applications of our analysis are reported: (i) measuring the conductivity of materials without employing a direct electrical contact between the electrodes and the sample and (ii) discriminating different phenomena of electrical polarization in complex materials by analyzing the scaling laws. Our study delivers thus a useful and necessary analysis of the dielectric behavior of composite materials, where interfacial polarization effects play a major role.},

  abstract = {Microbial induced carbonate precipitation (MICP) is a promising soil stabilization method performed by stimulating soil microbes that are naturally occurring and ubiquitous in soil systems. The precipitated carbonate acts as a cementation agent to bind loose soil at grain to grain contacts. MICP has been extensively tested and proven in laboratory environments, as well as in limited field trials; however, long term field applications still remain challenging, partly due to quality control and monitoring issues. Induced polarization (IP), an established geophysical method in mineral exploration, is a prime candidate for MICP monitoring and characterization. This study presents the geophysical results of a 15-day field-scale MICP project. The MICP treatment involved the injection of molasses (carbon source for microbial proliferation) and urea in a Ca2+ rich aquifer. IP monitoring successfully delineated, spatially and temporally, the propagation of MICP in the treatment area, while common resistivity measurements failed to capture any MICP related changes. Reduced hydraulic conductivity in the treatment area versus untreated area, further supports that MICP has changed the physical properties of the subsurface. Furthermore, conventional geochemical monitoring as well as X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed carbonate precipitation in samples from discrete wells in the treatment area.},

In this review, several aspects of the technology are considered. Firstly, a brief history of abiotic to biological fuel cells and subsequently, microbial fuel cells is presented. Secondly, the development of the concept of microbial fuel cell into a wider range of derivative technologies, called bioelectrochemical systems, is described introducing briefly microbial electrolysis cells, microbial desalination cells and microbial electrosynthesis cells. The focus is then shifted to electroactive biofilms and electron transfer mechanisms involved with solid electrodes. Carbonaceous and metallic anode materials are then introduced, followed by an explanation of the electro catalysis of the oxygen reduction reaction and its behavior in neutral media, from recent studies. Cathode catalysts based on carbonaceous, platinum-group metal and platinum-group-metal-free materials are presented, along with membrane materials with a view to future directions. Finally, microbial fuel cell practical implementation, through the utilization of energy output for practical applications, is described.},

  abstract = {The mapping of water content at a landslide sensitive area is important in order to identify the potency of ground motion. In such an area a minuscule amount of movement may lead to a catastrophic event. Water, which may act as a precursor of ground motion, changes the mechanical properties of the land, hence, changing the ability of the ground to resist gravitational force. In order to identify the water containment, as well as the flow of groundwater, we apply a geophysical method, namely the Self Potential (SP) measurement. Based on the analysis of Darcy's law the measurement result is related directly to the flow velocity. Although the measurement was performed on top of soil, the measured quantity is a response due to the amount of water infiltration into the soil. The mapped profile of the measurement identifies the flow pattern of groundwater. The result can be used to estimate the soil instability and the potency of landslide events. Our data shows the distribution of the groundwater in the observed area, which can be used as a hint to design the drainage system, in order to divert water from the landslide prone areas. The main goal of this work is to minimize the risk to the community by preventing groundwater flow from targeting inhabited regions, thus ensuring the safety of the residents.},

  abstract = {The onshore movement of marine fog is a common occurrence during summer months along much of the contiguous US Pacific Coast. Because the fog season tends to occur during the precipitation-free dry season, any additional input of moisture or reduction in loss of moisture through evapotranspiration provided by the marine layer can be an important factor in local hydrologic systems. To quantify some of the effects of fog on regional dry-season hydrology, a study site within the Santa Cruz Mountains of central California was established. The fog-laden coastside and predominately fog-free San Francisco Bay side of the study area provide an excellent opportunity to assess the impacts of the presence and absence of fog on ecohydrological processes. Streamflow, fog drip, and soil moisture were measured from May to September. Fog drip was essentially nonexistent on the bayside and highly variable on the coastside. Maximum rates and seasonal totals of drip occurred within stands of mature conifers (Sequoia sempervirens and Pseudotsuga menziesii) along exposed, often windy ridgelines. Fog-drip totals up to 961 mm were recorded over 2{$\cdot$}5 months. Consequently, frequent infiltration events to depths of 23 cm were documented. Over the course of the study, soil moisture levels at high-fog-drip locations either increased or were equivalent to spring conditions at the onset of data collection. Increases of flow in coastside streams, under otherwise receding conditions, were found to coincide with fog and fog-drip events. These results confirm that the presence of fog can significantly affect dry-season hydrologic conditions of some coastal locations. Copyright {\copyright} 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

We describe a computer program, rosetta, which implements {\textregistered}ve hierarchical pedotransfer functions \&PTFs) for the estimation of water retention, and the saturated and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity. The hierarchy in PTFs allows the estimation of van Genuchten water retention parameters and the saturated hydraulic conductivity using limited \&textural classes only) to more extended \&texture, bulk density, and one or two water retention points) input data. rosetta is based on neural network analyses combined with the bootstrap method, thus allowing the program to provide uncertainty estimates of the predicted hydraulic parameters. The general performance of rosetta was characterized with coef{\textregistered}cients of determination, and root mean square errors \&RMSEs). The RMSE values decreased from 0.078 to 0.044 cm3 cm23 for water retention when more predictors were used. The RMSE for the saturated conductivity similarly decreased from 0.739 to 0.647 \&dimensionless log10 units). The RMSE values for unsaturated conductivity ranged between 0.79 and 1.06, depending on whether measured or estimated retention parameters were used as predictors. Calculated mean errors showed that the PTFs underestimated water retention and the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity at relatively high suctions. rosetta's uncertainty estimates can be used as an indication of model reliability when no hydraulic data are available.

  abstract = {Quantitative knowledge of the unsaturated soil hydraulic properties is required in most studies involving water flow and solute transport in the vadose zone. Unfortunately, direct measurement of such properties is often difficult, expensive and time-consuming. Pedotransfer functions (PTFs) offer a means to estimate soil hydraulic properties based on predictors like texture, bulk density, and other soil variables. In this study, we focus on PTFs for water retention and show that systematic errors in five existing PTFs can be reduced by using water content--based objective functions, instead of parameter value--based objective functions. The alternative analysis was accomplished by establishing offset and slope coefficients for each estimated hydraulic parameter. Subsequently we evaluated these and six other PTFs for estimating water retention parameters using the NRCS soils database. A total of 47435 records containing 113970 observed water contents were used to test the PTFs for mean errors and root mean square errors. No overall superior model was found. Models with many calibration parameters or more input variables were not necessarily better than more simple models. All models underestimated water contents, with values ranging from -0.0086 to -0.0279 cm               3               cm               -3               Average root mean square errors ranged from 0.0687 cm               3               cm               -3               for a PTF that provided textural class average parameters to 0.0315 cm               3               cm               -3               for a model that also used two water retention points as predictors.

  abstract = {The characteristics of an aboveground cosmic-ray neutron sensor (CRNS) are evaluated for monitoring a mountain snowpack in the Austrian Alps from March 2014 to June 2016. Neutron counts were compared to continuous point-scale snow depth (SD) and snow-water-equivalent (SWE) measurements from an automatic weather station with a maximum SWE of 600 mm (April 2014). Several spatially distributed Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS)-based SD and SWE maps were additionally used. A strong nonlinear correlation is found for both SD and SWE. The representative footprint of the CRNS is in the range of 230--270 m. In contrast to previous studies suggesting signal saturation at around 100 mm of SWE, no complete signal saturation was observed. These results imply that CRNS could be transferred into an unprecedented method for continuous detection of spatially averaged SD and SWE for alpine snowpacks, though with sensitivity decreasing with increasing SWE. While initially different functions were found for accumulation and melting season conditions, this could be resolved by accounting for a limited measurement depth. This depth limit is in the range of 200 mm of SWE for dense snowpacks with high liquid water contents and associated snow density values around 450 kg m23 and above. In contrast to prior studies with shallow snowpacks, interannual transferability of the results is very high regardless of presnowfall soil moisture conditions. This underlines the unexpectedly high potential of CRNS to close the gap between point-scale measurements, hydrological models, and remote sensing of the cryosphere in alpine terrain.},

It is an improvement over previous models like the Vinegar and Waxman model, which do not account explicitly for the effect of frequency. The Vinegar and Waxman model can be considered as a limiting case of the Revil and Florsch model in the limit where the distribution of relaxation times is very broad. The extended model is applied to the case of unconsolidated sands partially saturated with oil and water. Laboratory experiments were performed to investigate the influence of oil saturation, frequency, grain size, and conductivity of the pore water upon the complex resistivity response of oil-bearing sands. The low-frequency polarization (below 100 Hz) is dominated by the polarization of the Stern layer (the inner part of the electrical double layer coating the surface of the grains in contact with water). The phase exhibits a well-defined relaxation peak with a peak frequency that is dependent on the mean grain diameter as predicted by the model. Both the resistivity and the magnitude of the phase increase with the relative saturation of the oil. The imaginary (quadrature) component of the complex conductivity is observed to decrease with the oil saturation. All these observations are reproduced by the new model.},

  abstract = {Abstract. In the last few years the method of cosmic-ray neutron sensing~(CRNS) has gained popularity among hydrologists, physicists, and land-surface modelers. The sensor provides continuous soil moisture data, averaged over several hectares and tens of decimeters in depth. However, the signal still may contain unidentified features of hydrological processes, and many calibration datasets are often required in order to find reliable relations between neutron intensity and water dynamics. Recent insights into environmental neutrons accurately described the spatial sensitivity of the sensor and thus allowed one to quantify the contribution of individual sample locations to the CRNS signal. Consequently, data points of calibration and validation datasets are suggested to be averaged using a more physically based weighting approach. In this work, a revised sensitivity function is used to calculate weighted averages of point data. The function is different from the simple exponential convention by the extraordinary sensitivity to the first few meters around the probe, and by dependencies on air pressure, air humidity, soil moisture, and vegetation. The approach is extensively tested at six distinct monitoring sites: two sites with multiple calibration datasets and four sites with continuous time series datasets. In all cases, the revised averaging method improved the performance of the CRNS products. The revised approach further helped to reveal hidden hydrological processes which otherwise remained unexplained in the data or were lost in the process of overcalibration. The presented weighting approach increases the overall accuracy of CRNS products and will have an impact on all their applications in agriculture, hydrology, and modeling.},

As OSS developers work independently on interdependent modules, they create a larger cohesive whole in the form of an ecosystem, leaving traces of their contributions and collaborations. Data harvested from these traces enable the study of large-scale decentralized collaborative work. We present curated data on the activity of tens of thousands of developers in the Rust ecosystem and the evolving dependencies between their libraries. The data covers eight years of developer contributions to Rust libraries and can be used to reconstruct the ecosystem's development history, such as growing developer collaboration networks or dependency networks. These are complemented by data on downloads and popularity, tracking dynamics of use, visibility, and success over time. Altogether the data give a comprehensive view of several dimensions of the ecosystem.},

  abstract = {The flow of water between soil and plants follows the gradient in water potential and depends on the hydraulic properties of the soil and the root. In models for root water uptake (RWU), it is usually assumed that the hydraulic properties near the plant root (i.e., in the rhizosphere) and in the bulk soil are identical. Yet a growing body of evidence has shown that the hydraulic properties of the rhizosphere are affected by root exudates (specifically, mucilage) and markedly differ from those of the bulk soil. In this work, we couple a 3-D detailed description of RWU with a model that accounts for the rhizosphere-specific properties (i.e., rhizosphere hydraulic properties and a nonequilibrium relation between water content and matric head). We show that as the soil dries out (due to water uptake), the higher water holding capacity of the rhizosphere results in a delay of the stress onset. During rewetting, nonequilibrium results in a slower increase of the rhizosphere water content. Furthermore, the inverse relation between water content and relaxation time implies that the drier is the rhizosphere the longer it takes to rewet. Another outcome of nonequilibrium is the small fluctuation of the rhizosphere water content compared to the bulk soil. Overall, our numerical results are in agreement with recent experimental data and provide a tool to further examine the impact of various rhizosphere processes on RWU and water dynamics.},

With this approach, it is possible to apply the dye solution directly to the stem, enabling a more advanced technique to represent the flow processes than has been used in previous studies. Stemflow concentrates and channels water over localized circular areas at the tree base, as shown in this study. Tracing stemflow using dye demonstrated that infiltrating stemflow water was preferentially funneled belowground along heart and sinker roots, laterally oriented coarse roots, and congregations of fine roots grown into decayed root channels of felled trees. The results presented in this study reveal that stemflow and root induced preferential flow triggers fast lateral subsurface flow bypassing large parts of the soil matrix at least during rainstorm events. Based on our measurements, we hypothesize that the formation of stemflow and the channeling of infiltrating stemflow water along the roots of beech trees might be an important mechanism of runoff generation in forested catchments.},

Depending on the orchard, the different drip emitter arrangements included either: (1) emitters spaced continuously at 1-m intervals along the drip line (CE-4; 4 emitters per tree); (2) 4 emitters per tree spaced at 1-m intervals, but with a space of 2 m between emitters of neighbouring trees (E-4); or (3) 2 emitters per tree with 4 m between emitters of neighbouring trees (E-2). All of the orchards included either var. Manzanilla fina or Manzanilla reina trees (5--8 years old) growing in sandy soils, although the specific characteristics of each orchard differed. Root length density values (2.5--3.5 cm/cm3) in the upper soil depth (0--0.5 m) were fairly uniform along the drip line in the continuous emitter (CE-4) orchard. In contrast, roots were more concentrated in the E-4 and E-2 orchards, in some cases with maximum RLD values of up to 7 cm/cm3. Approximately 70\% of the root system was located in the upper 0.5 m of soil depth, and most of the roots were within 0.5 m of the drip line. For each of the three orchards, significant linear relationships between soil water content and RLD were detected based on 42 sampling positions that included various distances from the trunk and soil depths. Values of RLD averaged over the entire rooting zone and total tree root length per leaf area for the three orchards were estimated to range from 0.19 to 0.48 cm/cm3 and from 1.8 to 3.5 km/m2, respectively. These results should reduce the uncertainty associated with the magnitude of RLD values under drip irrigation as intensively managed olive orchards continue to expand in established and new growing regions.},

  abstract = {By 1930, the resistivity log was recorded commercially in several countries, and in 1931 the self-potential (SP) measurement was added. An electromagnetic (EM) teleclinometer was introduced in 1932, a continuous temperature log in 1933, and an anisotropy dipmeter ca. 1935. The significance of the SP was an ongoing study until about 1962. The bases for the quantitative interpretation of resistivity for saturation were formulated by 1941. The years from about 1940 into the 1960s saw the development of other basic logs---dipmeter, gamma ray, neutron, induction, microresistivity, focused resistivity, density, and acoustic velocity---as well as other miscellaneous logs. Suites of resistivity logs were evolved to provide more accurate analysis. Much effort was expended on the interpretation of shaly sands. Neutron, density, and acoustic logs yielded information on porosity, lithology, gas saturation, and/or shaliness. Availability of porosity from these logs facilitated resistivity-log interpretation. In the late 1950s, interest developed in the use of computers for log interpretation. By about 1961, dipmeter logs were being recorded on digital magnetic tape suitable for computer input, and other logs were available by about 1965. Digital recording has also facilitated transmission of logs via radio and telephone. Recently, digital systems for wellsite computations have been introduced.},

Starting from the fundamental representation of a volume dipolar distribution, one is led to the concept of a change in apparent conductivity due to polarization effects. The mathematical solution of induced polarization phenomena, therefore, reduces to the appropriate solution of Laplace's equation for the same geometry and conductivity distribution ignoring polarization, followed by partial differentiation of the apparent resistivity function so determined. The dielectric constants of the media are not involved in the solution. As examples of the use of the representation, the response of a polarizable sphere and of a polarizable lower layer in a typical two-layer case are presented. Actual field results are shown illustrating the use of the latter solution.},

  abstract = {The prealpine Rietholzbach research catchment provides long-term continuous hydroclimatological measurements in northeastern Switzerland, including lysimeter evapotranspiration measurements since 1976, and soil moisture measurements since 1994. We analyze here the monthly data record over 32 years (1976--2007), with a focus on the extreme 2003 European drought. In particular, we assess whether the well-established hypothesis that the 2003 event was due to spring precipitation deficits is valid at the site. The Rietholzbach measurements are found to be internally consistent and representative for a larger region in Switzerland. Despite the scale discrepancy (3.14 m               2               versus 3.31 km               2               ), the lysimeter seepage and catchment-wide streamflow show similar monthly dynamics. High correlations are further found with other streamflow measurements within the Thur river basin (1750 km               2               ) and---for interannual anomalies---also in most of northern Switzerland. Analyses for 2003 confirm the occurrence of extreme heat and drought conditions at Rietholzbach. However, unlike findings from regional-scale modeling studies, they reveal a late onset of the soil moisture deficit (from June onward), despite large precipitation deficits from mid-February to mid-April. These early spring deficits were mostly compensated for by decreased runoff during this period and excess precipitation in the preceding weeks to months (including in the 2002 fall). Our results show that evapotranspiration excess in June 2003 was the main driver initiating the 2003 summer drought conditions in Rietholzbach, contributing 60\% of the June 2003 water storage deficit. Finally, long-lasting drought effects on the lysimeter water storage due to rewetting inhibition were recorded until spring 2004.                        ,              Key Points                                                                Unique hydroclimatological data set including multidecadal lysimeter record                                                     Evapotranspiration as major and underestimated driver of 2003 European drought                                                     Precipitation deficits in spring 2003 play a minor role for drought development},

  abstract = {It is necessary to establish the rate law of adsorbate--adsorbent interactions to understand the mechanism by which the solute accumulates on the surface of a solid and gets adsorbed to the surface. A number of theoretical models and equations are available for the purpose and the best fit of the experimental data to any of these models is interpreted as giving the appropriate kinetics for the adsorption process. There is a spate of publications during the last few years on adsorption of various metals and other contaminants on conventional and non-conventional adsorbents, and many have tried to work out the kinetics. This has resulted from the wide interest generated on using adsorption as a practical method for treating contaminated water. In this review, an attempt has been made to discuss the kinetics of adsorption of metal ions on inorganic solids on the basis of published reports. A variety of materials like clays and clay minerals, zeolites, silica gel, soil, activated alumina, inorganic polymer, inorganic oxides, fly ash, etc. have been considered as the adsorbents and cations and anions of As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Se, and Zn as adsorbate have been covered in this review. The majority of the interactions have been divided into either pseudo first order or second order kinetics on the basis of the best fit obtained by various groups of workers, although second order kinetics has been found to be the most predominant one. The discussion under each category is carried out with respect to each type of metal ion separately. Application of models as given by the Elovich equation, intra-particle diffusion and liquid film diffusion has also been shown by many authors and these have also been reviewed. The time taken for attaining equilibrium in each case has been considered as a significant parameter and is discussed almost in all the cases. The values of the kinetic rate coefficients indicate the speed at which the metal ions adsorb on the materials and these are discussed in all available cases. The review aims to give a comprehensive picture on the studies of kinetics of adsorption during the last few years.},

  abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT)-based automation of agricultural events can change the agriculture sector from being static and manual to dynamic and smart, leading to enhanced production with reduced human efforts. Precision Agriculture (PA) along with Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) are the main drivers of automation in the agriculture domain. PA uses specific sensors and software to ensure that the crops receive exactly what they need to optimize productivity and sustainability. PA includes retrieving real data about the conditions of soil, crops and weather from the sensors deployed in the fields. High-resolution images of crops are obtained from satellite or air-borne platforms (manned or unmanned), which are further processed to extract information used to provide future decisions. In this paper, a review of near and remote sensor networks in the agriculture domain is presented along with several considerations and challenges. This survey includes wireless communication technologies, sensors, and wireless nodes used to assess the environmental behaviour, the platforms used to obtain spectral images of crops, the common vegetation indices used to analyse spectral images and applications of WSN in agriculture. As a proof of concept, we present a case study showing how WSN-based PA system can be implemented. We propose an IoT-based smart solution for crop health monitoring, which is comprised of two modules. The first module is a wireless sensor network-based system to monitor real-time crop health status. The second module uses a low altitude remote sensing platform to obtain multi-spectral imagery, which is further processed to classify healthy and unhealthy crops. We also highlight the results obtained using a case study and list the challenges and future directions based on our work.},

  abstract = {The accuracy of the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to model the airflow around the buildings in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) is directly linked to the utilized turbulence model. Despite the popularity and their low computational cost, the current Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) models cannot accurately resolve the wake regions behind the buildings. The default values of the RANS models' closure coefficients in CFD tools such as ANSYS CFX, ANSYS FLUENT, PHOENIX, and STAR CCM{\th} are mainly adapted from other fields and physical problems, which are not perfectly suitable for ABL flow modeling. This study embarks on proposing a systematic approach to find the optimum values for the closure coefficients of RANS models in order to significantly improve the accuracy of CFD simulations for urban studies. The methodology is based on stochastic optimization and Monte Carlo Sampling technique. To show the capability of the method, a test case of airflow around an isolated building placed in a non-isothermal unstable ABL was considered. The recommended values for this case study in accordance with the optimization method were thus found to be 1:45 C{$\varepsilon$}1 1:5, 2:7 C{$\varepsilon$}2 3, and 0:12 C{$\mu$} 0:15. The default value of {$\sigma$}k {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1 is suggested to be acceptable while the value of {$\sigma\varepsilon$} is obtained through a correlation. The error of the estimated reattachment length behind the building decreased form 170\% for the default values to 28\% for the modified values.},

  abstract = {Abstract             One way to increase yield potential in wheat is screening for natural variation in photosynthesis. This study uses measured and modelled physiological parameters to explore genotypic diversity in photosynthetic capacity (Pc, Rubisco carboxylation capacity per unit leaf area at 25 {$^\circ$}C) and efficiency (Peff, Pc per unit of leaf nitrogen) in wheat in relation to fertilizer, plant stage, and environment. Four experiments (Aus1, Aus2, Aus3, and Mex1) were carried out with diverse wheat collections to investigate genetic variation for Rubisco capacity (Vcmax25), electron transport rate (J), CO2 assimilation rate, stomatal conductance, and complementary plant functional traits: leaf nitrogen, leaf dry mass per unit area, and SPAD. Genotypes for Aus1 and Aus2 were grown in the glasshouse with two fertilizer levels. Genotypes for Aus3 and Mex1 experiments were grown in the field in Australia and Mexico, respectively. Results showed that Vcmax25 derived from gas exchange measurements is a robust parameter that does not depend on stomatal conductance and was positively correlated with Rubisco content measured in vitro. There was significant genotypic variation in most of the experiments for Pc and Peff. Heritability of Pc reached 0.7 and 0.9 for SPAD. Genotypic variation and heritability of traits show that there is scope for these traits to be used in pre-breeding programmes to improve photosynthesis with the ultimate objective of raising yield potential.},

Despite its importance, the root microbiome is challenging to study because of its complexity, heterogeneity, and subterranean location. Fortunately, root microbiome research has seen a tremendous influx of novel technologies (e.g., imaging tools, robotics, and molecular analyses), experimental platforms (e.g., micro- and mesocosms), and data integration, modeling, and prediction tools in the past decade that have greatly increased our ability to dissect the complex network of interactions between above- and belowground environmental parameters, plants, bacteria, and fungi that dictate soil and broader ecosystem health. Herein, we discuss methods that are currently used in root microbiome research and that can be expanded to phytobiome research in general ranging from laboratory studies to mesocosm-scale studies and, finally, to field studies; evaluate their relevance to ecosystem studies; and discuss future root microbiome research directions.},

  abstract = {The induced polarization (IP) response of rocks and soils is a function of lithology and fluid conductivity. IP measurements are sensitive to the low-frequency capacitive properties of rocks and soils, which are controlled by diffusion polarization mechanisms operating at the grain-fluid interface. IP interpretation typically is in terms of the conventional field IP parameters: chargeability, percentage frequency effect, and phase angle. These parameters are dependent upon both surface polarization mechanisms and bulk (volumetric) conduction mechanisms. Consequently, they afford a poor quantification of surface polarization processes of interest to the field geophysicist. A parameter that quantifies the magnitude of surface polarization is the normalized chargeability, defined as the chargeability divided by the resistivity magnitude. This parameter is proportional to the quadrature conductivity measured in the complex resistivity method. For nonmetallic minerals, the quadrature conductivity and normalized chargeability are closely related to lithology (through the specific surface area) and surface chemistry. Laboratory and field experiments were performed to determine the dependence of the standard IP parameters and the normalized chargeability on two important environmental parameters: salinity and clay content. The laboratory experiments illustrate that the chargeability is strongly correlated with the sample resistivity, which depends on salinity, porosity, saturation, and clay content. The normalized chargeability is shown to be independent of the sample resistivity and it is proportional to the quadrature conductivity, which is directly related to the surface polarization processes. Laboratory-derived relationships between conductivity and salinity, and normalized chargeability and clay content, are extended to the interpretation of 1-D and 2-D field-IP surveys. In the 2-D survey, the apparent conductivity and normalized chargeability data are used to segment the images into relatively clay-free and clay-rich zones. A similar approach can eventually be used to predict relative variations in the subsurface clay content, salinity and, perhaps, contaminant concentrations.},

  abstract = {The permeable reactive barrier (PRB) is a promising in-situ technology for treatment of hydrocarbon-contaminated groundwater. A PRB is typically composed of granular iron which degrades chlorinated organics into potentially nontoxic dehalogenated organic compounds and inorganic chloride. Geophysical methods may assist assessment of in-situ barrier integrity and evaluation of long-term barrier performance. The highly conductive granular iron makes the PRB an excellent target for conductivity imaging methods. In addition, electrochemical storage of charge at the iron--solution interface generates an impedance that decreases with frequency. The PRB is thus a potential induced polarization (IP) target. Surface and cross-borehole electrical imaging (conductivity and IP) was conducted at a PRB installed at the U.S. Department of Energy's Kansas City plant. Poor signal strength (25\% of measurements exceeding 8\% reciprocal error) and insensitivity at depth, which results from current channeling in the highly conductive iron, limited surface imaging. Crosshole 2D and 3D electrical measurements were highly effective at defining an accurate, approximately 0.3-m resolution, cross-sectional image of the barrier in-situ. Both the conductivity and IP images reveal the barrier geometry. Crosshole images obtained for seven panels along the barrier suggest variability in iron emplacement along the installation. On five panels the PRB structure is imaged as a conductive feature exceeding 1 S/m. However, on two panels the conductivity in the assumed vicinity of the PRB is less than 1 S/m. The images also suggest variability in the integrity of the contact between the PRB and bedrock. This noninvasive, in-situ evaluation of barrier geometry using conductivity/IP has broad implications for the long-term monitoring of PRB performance as a method of hydrocarbon removal.},

Our key findings are: (a) Polarization magnitude exhibits a linear relation to the surface area of [Formula: see text], whereas conduction magnitude is only weakly dependent on the [Formula: see text] concentration below 30\% by volume [Formula: see text]. (b) Polarization magnitude shows a power law relation to electrolyte activity, with exponents decreasing from 0.9 for monovalent solutions to 0.7 for trivalent solutions. (c) The relaxation time parameter depends on activity and valence in a manner that is partly consistent with the variation in double layer thickness predicted from theory. (d) pH exerts minor control on the electrical parameters. (e) Polarization magnitude and relaxation time both increase as a result of precipitation induced on the surface of [Formula: see text]. Our results show that induced polarization parameters systematically change in response to changes in the [Formula: see text]-electrolyte interfacial chemistry.},

In the first part of this paper, research describing how petrophysical relations between electrical properties and effective (i.e. controlling fluid transport) properties of (a) the interconnected pore volumes and interconnected pore surfaces, have been exploited to estimate K at both the core and field scale is reviewed. We start with electrical resistivity measurements, which are shown to be inherently limited in K estimation as, although resistivity is sensitive to both pore volume and pore surface area properties, the two contributions cannot be separated. Efforts to utilize the unique sensitivity of IP and SIP measurements to physical parameters that describe the interconnected pore surface area are subsequently introduced and the incorporation of such data into electrical based Kozeny--Carman type models of K estimation is reviewed. In the second part of this review, efforts to invert geophysical datasets for spatial patterns of K variability (e.g. aquifer geometries) at the field-scale are considered. Inversions, based on the conversion of an image of a geophysical property to a hydrological property assuming a valid petrophysical relationship, as well as joint/constrained inversion methods, whereby multiple geophysical and hydrological data are inverted simultaneously, are briefly covered. This review demonstrates that there currently exists an opportunity to link, (1) the petrophysics relating low frequency electrical measurements to effective hydraulic properties, with (2) the joint inversion strategies developed in recent years, in order to obtain more meaningful estimates of spatial patterns of K variability than previously reported.},

Developmental and physiological factors other than phylloxera resistance, lime tolerance, and ease of propagation were not directly considered during rootstock breeding, including rooting patterns. Here, in a comprehensive literature synthesis, we have compiled information concerning rooting depth distributions of grapevine roots from wall profile studies comprising a broad range of soil environments and rootstock genotypes. We considered the distributions based on the asymptotic equation of Y = (1 - {\ss}d), where d = soil depth (cm) and Y = the proportion of roots from the surface to depth d. The median value of {\ss} for the root distributions analyzed was 0.9826 and the standard deviation over all observations was 0.0068 (n = 240); most profiles had fitted values of {\ss} generally greater than 0.975. This value places the depth distribution of grapevine roots in the vadose zone among the deepest observed for plants worldwide. The data suggested that soil properties such as the presence of soil profiles impermeable to root penetration, stoniness, and presence of gravel lenses have a greater influence on depth distributions than does genotype, even in deep fertile soils. Genotypic differences were not apparent, although the rootstock O3916 ({\ss} = 0.9867 {\textpm} 0.0009, mean {\textpm} se, n = 11), with a reputation for deep-rooting behavior, did exhibit deeper root distributions. The analysis also suggests that root characteristics other than root horizontal and vertical spread may need to be considered in order to explain some key rootstock characteristics like scion vigor or drought tolerance.},

Factoring out natural from direct and indirect human influence is not always straightforward, but some human activities have clear impacts. These include land-use change, land management and land degradation (erosion, compaction, sealing and salinization). The intensity of land use also exerts a great impact on soils, and soils are also subject to indirect impacts arising from human activity, such as acid deposition (sulphur and nitrogen) and heavy metal pollution. In this critical review, we report the state-of-the-art understanding of these global change pressures on soils, identify knowledge gaps and research challenges and highlight actions and policies to minimize adverse environmental impacts arising from these global change drivers. Soils are central to considerations of what constitutes sustainable intensification. Therefore, ensuring that vulnerable and high environmental value soils are considered when protecting important habitats and ecosystems, will help to reduce the pressure on land from global change drivers. To ensure that soils are protected as part of wider environmental efforts, a global soil resilience programme should be considered, to monitor, recover or sustain soil fertility and function, and to enhance the ecosystem services provided by soils. Soils cannot, and should not, be considered in isolation of the ecosystems that they underpin and vice versa. The role of soils in supporting ecosystems and natural capital needs greater recognition.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Using the relationship between measured groundwater pressures in deep observation wells and total surface loading, a geological weighing lysimeter (geolysimeter) has the capability of measuring precipitation event totals independently of conventional precipitation gauge observations. Correlations between groundwater pressure change and event precipitation were observed at a co-located site near Duck Lake, SK, over a multi-year and multi-season period. Correlation coefficients (r2) varied from 0.99 for rainfall to 0.94 for snowfall. The geolysimeter was shown to underestimate rainfall by 7\,\% while overestimating snowfall by 9\,\% as compared to the unadjusted gauge precipitation. It is speculated that the underestimation of rainfall is due to unmeasured run-off and evapotranspiration within the response area of the geolysimeter during larger rainfall events, while the overestimation of snow is at least partially due to the systematic undercatch common to most precipitation gauges due to wind. Using recently developed transfer functions from the World Meteorological Organization's (WMO) Solid Precipitation Intercomparison Experiment (SPICE), bias adjustments were applied to the Alter-shielded, Geonor T-200B precipitation gauge measurements of snowfall to mitigate wind-induced errors. The bias between the gauge and geolysimeter measurements was reduced to 3\,\%. This suggests that the geolysimeter is capable of accurately measuring solid precipitation and can be used as an independent and representative reference of true precipitation.},

This change in irrigation method has a significant effect on moisture distribution within the soil profile, with implications for root growth, rootsystem architecture, and soil-water acquisition. Those issues are addressed in this paper. Our report is based on grapevines that had been established under a diffuse irrigation system (overhead sprinklers or microjets) and subsequently converted to drippers. Results are also presented to show the influence of soils with different water holding capacities on root distribution within a single vineyard. Variations in soil texture within a vineyard were found to influence the vertical distribution of roots, whereas irrigation history had more influence on horizontal variations in root density within a depth range. Conversion of vines from sprinkler irrigation to drippers resulted in a marked increase in total root mass (volume) under the drip line, particularly 25--50 cm below the surface. Roots were differentially influenced by irrigation history according to their diameter class. Under drip irrigation, the largest increase in root-length density occurred with roots in diameter classes between 1 and 4 mm diameter. Grapevines established under sprinklers, and subsequently converted to drip irrigation, had significantly larger root systems (within the volume of soil sampled) than did vines maintained under sprinklers throughout. Therefore, vines established under sprinkler irrigation and then converted to drippers may be better equipped to cope with deficit irrigation during drought (via either RDI or PRD), by virtue of those additional roots.},

At the bottom of the device there is an outflow for atmospheric precipitation water infiltrating to a measuring container. Lysimeter studies are included in the group of dynamic leaching tests in which the leaching solution is added in a specified volume over a specific period of time. Lysimeter studies find applications in, amongst others, agrotechnics, hydrogeology and geochemistry. Lysimeter tests may vary in terms of the type of soil used (anthropogenic soil, natural soil), sample size, leaching solution, duration of the research and the purpose for conducting it. Lysimeter experiments provide more accurate results for leaching tests compared with static leaching tests. Unlike several-day tests, they should last for at least a year. There are about 2,500 lysimeters installed in nearly 200 stations around Europe. The vast majority of these (84\%) are non-weighing lysimeters. There are a few challenges for lysimeter research mostly connected with the construction of the lysimeter, estimating leaching results and calibrating numerical transport models with data obtained from lysimeters. This review is devoted to the analysis of the principal types of lysimeters described in the literature within the context of their application. The aim of this study is to highlight the role of lysimeters in leaching studies.},

Thus, any transport model that treats unsaturated soil conductivity would benefit by also incorporating the analogous xylem vulnerability curves. This is especially the case for crop plants, which as a group have relatively vulnerable xylem. Although the cohesion--tension mechanism for xylem transport has withstood recent challenges, a number of gaps remain in our understanding of xylem hydraulics. These include the extent and mechanism of cavitation reversal and thus hysteresis in the vulnerability curve, the structural basis for differences in air entry pressure (ϭcavitation pressure) for different xylem types, a quantitative model of xylem conductivity, and a mechanistic understanding of how stomata regulate plant water status. Improving the representation of xylem hydraulics in models of crop water use is necessary to achieve a mechanistic link between soil water availability and canopy water use. An important additional knowledge gap concerns the hydraulics of the living tissues of absorbing roots and transpiring leaves, which are more complex than in xylem and less amenable to mechanistic modeling at present.},

  abstract = {The time or frequency at which the electromagnetic (EM) response of a buried inhomogeneity can first be measured is determined by its depth of burial and the average conductivity of the overlying section; it is relatively independent of the type of source or receiver and their separation. The ability to make measurements at this time or frequency, however, depends on the sensitivity and accuracy of the instrumentation, the signal strength, and the ambient noise level. These factors affect different EM sounding systems in surprisingly different ways. For the magnetotelluric (MT) method, it is possible to detect a buried half-space under about 1.5 skin depths of overburden. The maximum depth of investigation is virtually unbounded because of high signal strengths at low frequencies. Transient electromagnetic (TEM) soundings, on the other hand, have a limited depth of penetration, but are less affected by static shift errors. For TEM, a buried inhomogeneity can be detected under about one diffusion depth of overburden. For conventional near-zone sounding in which induced voltage is measured (impulse response), the depth of investigation is proportional to the [Formula: see text] power of the source moment and ground resistivity. By contrast, if the receiver is a magnetometer (step response system), the depth of investigation is proportional to the [Formula: see text] power of source moment and is no longer a function of resistivity. Magnetic-field measurements may, therefore, be superior for exploration in conductive areas such as sedimentary basins. Far-zone, or long-offset, TEM soundings are traditionally used for deep exploration. The depth of investigation for a voltage receiver is proportional to the [Formula: see text] power of source moment and resistivity and is inversely proportional to the source-receiver separation. Magnetic-field measurements are difficult to make at long offsets because instrumental accuracy limits the measurement of the very slow decay of the magnetic field. Frequency-domain controlled-source systems are ideally suited for sounding at the very shallow depths needed for engineering, archaeological, and groundwater applications because of the relative ease of extending the measurements to arbitrarily high frequencies, and also because geometric soundings can be made at low induction numbers.},

  abstract = {Interpolation of seismic traces is an effective means of improving migration when the data set exhibits spatial aliasing. A major difficulty of standard interpolation methods is that they depend on the degree of reliability with which the various geological events can be separated. In this respect, a multichannel interpolation method is described which requires neither a priori knowledge of the directions of lateral coherence of the events, nor estimation of these directions. The method is based on the fact that linear events present in a section made of equally spaced traces may be interpolated exactly, regardless of the original spatial interval, without any attempt to determine their true dips. The predictability of linear events in the f-x domain allows the missing traces to be expressed as the output of a linear system, the input of which consists of the recorded traces. The interpolation operator is obtained by solving a set of linear equations whose coefficients depend only on the spectrum of the spatial prediction filter defined by the recorded traces. Synthetic examples show that this method is insensitive to random noise and that it correctly handles curvatures and lateral amplitude variations. Assessment of the method with a real data set shows that the interpolation yields an improved migrated section.},

Among experiments, mesocosms have become increasingly popular because they provide an important bridge between smaller, more tightly controlled, microcosm experiments (which can suffer from limited realism) and the greater biological complexity of natural systems (in which mechanistic relationships often cannot be identified). A new evaluation of the contribution of the mesocosm approach, its potential for future research, as well as its limitations, is timely. As part of this review, we constructed a new database of over 250 post-1990 studies that have explored different components of climate change across a range of organisational levels, scales, and habitats. Issues related to realism, reproducibility and control are assessed in marine, freshwater, and terrestrial systems. Some general patterns emerged, particularly at the ecosystem level, such as consistent and predictable effects on whole-system respiration rates. There are, however, also many seemingly idiosyncratic, contingent responses, especially at the community level, both within and among habitat types. These similarities and differences in both the drivers and responses highlight the need for caution before making generalisations. Finally, we assess future directions and prospects for new methodological advances and the need for greater international coordination and interdisciplinarity.},

To prove the accuracy of the GPR, measurements were carried out on four lysimeters (surface 1 m2, depth 1.5 m) during one vegetation period. The lysimeters were planted with lucerne and filled with three different soils: a loamy sand, a sandy loam and a silt loam. The ground water tables were at 1.35 and 2.1 m. The lysimeters were weighed, so that it was possible to calculate the changes in water content with very high accuracy. For the GPR-measurements a 1 GHz-antenna was used. Only in the sandy loam reflected signal from the bottom of the lysimeter could be obtained. The standard deviation between the GPR and the lysimeter data was 0.01 m3/m3 using all data and 0.0026 m3/m3 using only measurements in the wetter range. For this material an experimental calibration curve between the soil water content (u ) and the relative dielectric constant (1 ) was calculated by comparing GPR-results with lysimeter data. The data results in a linear function u(1 ) for the measured range of water contents. Compared to published calibration curves used for TDR-technique, the Topp-function gives the best results. q 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Evaporation (E) and transpiration (T ) respond differently to ongoing changes in climate, atmospheric composition, and land use. It is difficult to partition ecosystem-scale evapotranspiration (ET) measurements into E and T , which makes it difficult to validate satellite data and land surface models. Here, we review current progress in partitioning E and T and provide a prospectus for how to improve theory and observations going forward. Recent advancements in analytical techniques create new opportunities for partitioning E and T at the ecosystem scale, but their assumptions have yet to be fully tested. For example, many approaches to partition E and T rely on the notion that plant canopy conductance and ecosystem water use efficiency exhibit optimal responses to atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (D). We use observations from 240 eddy covariance flux towers to demonstrate that optimal ecosystem response to D is a reasonable assumption, in agreement with recent studies, but more analysis is necessary to determine the conditions for which this assumption holds. Another critical assumption for many partitioning approaches is that ET can be approximated as T during ideal transpiring conditions, which has been challenged by observational studies. We demonstrate that T can exceed 95 \% of ET from certain ecosystems, but other ecosystems do not appear to reach this value, which suggests that this assumption is ecosystem-dependent with implications for partitioning. It is important to further improve approaches for partitioning E and T , yet few multi-method comparisons have been undertaken to date. Advances in our understanding of carbon--water coupling at the stomatal, leaf, and canopy level open new perspectives on how to quantify T via its strong coupling with photosynthesis. Photosynthesis can be constrained at the ecosystem and global scales with emerging data sources including solar-induced fluorescence, carbonyl sulfide flux measurements, thermography, and more. Such comparisons would improve our mechanistic understanding of ecosystem water fluxes and provide the observations necessary to validate remote sensing algorithms and land surface models to understand the changing global water cycle.},

  abstract = {This is a textbook to help readers understand the steps that lead to deep learning. Linear algebra comes first especially singular values, least squares, and matrix factorizations. Often the goal is a low rank approximation A = CR (column-row) to a large matrix of data to see its most important part. This uses the full array of applied linear algebra, including randomization for very large matrices. Then deep learning creates a large-scale optimization problem for the weights solved by gradient descent or better stochastic gradient descent. Finally, the book develops the architectures of fully connected neural nets and of Convolutional Neural Nets (CNNs) to find patterns in data. Audience: This book is for anyone who wants to learn how data is reduced and interpreted by and understand matrix methods. Based on the second linear algebra course taught by Professor Strang, whose lectures on the training data are widely known, it starts from scratch (the four fundamental subspaces) and is fully accessible without the first text.},

  abstract = {Understanding the hydro-biogeochemical conditions that impact the mobility of uranium (U) in natural or artificial wetlands is essential for the management of contaminated environments. Field-based research indicates that high organic matter content and saturation of the soil from the water table create favorable conditions for U accumulation. Despite the installation of artificial wetlands for U remediation, the processes that can release U from wetland soils to underlying aquifers are poorly understood. Here we used a large soil core from a montane wetland in a 6 year lysimeter experiment to study the stability of U accumulated to levels of up to 6000 ppm. Amendments with electron acceptors showed that the wetland soil can reduce sulfate and Fe(III) in large amounts without significant release of U into the soil pore water. However, amendment with carbonate (5 mM, pH 7.5) resulted in a large discharge of U. After a six-month period of imposed drought, the re-flooding of the core led to the release of negligible amounts of U into the pore water. This long-term experiment demonstrates that U is strongly bound to organic matter and that its stability is only challenged by carbonate complexation.},

To exploit better the full capabilities of multielectrode acquisition systems, we have developed an experimental design procedure to identify suites of electrode configurations that provide subsurface information according to predefined optimization criteria. The experimental design algorithm includes a goodness function that ranks the sensitivity of every possible electrode configuration to changes in the subsurface parameters. To examine the potential and limitations of the new algorithm, comprehensive data sets that included data from all standard and nonstandard electrode configurations were (a) generated for a complex 2D resistivity model and (b) recorded across a well-studied test site in Switzerland. Images determined from the resultant comprehensive data sets were used as benchmarks against which the images derived from the optimized data sets were assessed. Images from relatively small optimized data sets, containing 265--282 data points, provided more information than did those from standard data sets of equal size. By far the best images, comparable to those determined from the much larger comprehensive data sets, were obtained from optimized data sets with 1000--6000 data points. These images supplied reliable information over depth ranges that were three times greater than the depth ranges resolved by the standard images. The first {$\sim$}600 electrode configurations selected by the experimental design procedure were nonstandard dipole-dipole-type arrays, whereas the following {$\sim$}4800 electrode configurations were an approximately equal mix of nonstandard dipole-dipole-type arrays and nested configurations (i.e., mostly gradient and other nonstandard arrays).},

The influence of the ambient temperature, as well as the load on the output frequency of a generator with a phasing chain of strain gauges of a mass measuring device, is studied. The form of the conversion function recording is obtained, which is convenient for studying the influence of simultaneous changes in the parameters of several load cells or the sensitivity with respect to many elements that affect the change in the frequency of the generator. The data processed is displayed in the units of mass considering the ambient temperature. A block diagram of a continuous dynamic weighing technique, using standard strain gages with averaging readings without additional computing devices, has been proposed.},

It is a basic staple grain for large groups of people in Africa, Latin America, and Asia. In tropical countries, a large proportion of the maize is harvested and stored under humid and warm climatic conditions, which subsequently results in rapid deterioration of the grains, mainly because of growth of molds and pests. This study reviewed the main factors that lead to deterioration of maize in tropical countries and suggests ways of preventing the identified causes. This paper also reviews world production, varieties, climatic and storage conditions of maize. Deterioration of maize is mainly affected by moisture content, temperature (grain and air), relative humidity, storage conditions, fungal growth, and insect pests. Fungal growth, especially Aspergillus flavus and Fusarium sp in maize, facilitated by hot and humid conditions, poses a major risk through production of mycotoxins. In order to maintain high quality maize for both short- and long-term storage, maize must be protected from weather, growth of microorganisms, and pests.},

  abstract = {Silica is the most abundant metal oxide and the main component of the Earth's crust. Its behavior in contact with water plays a critical role in a variety of geochemical and environmental processes. Despite its key role, the details of the aqueous silica interface at the microscopic molecular level are still elusive. Here we provide such a detailed understanding of the molecular behavior of the silica-water interface, using density functional theory based molecular dynamics (DFTMD) simulations, where a consistent treatment of the electronic structure of solvent and surface is provided. We have calculated the acidity of the silanol groups at the interface directly from the DFTMD simulations, without any fitting of parameters to the experimental data. We find two types of silanol groups at the surface of quartz: out-of-plane silanols with a strong acidic character (pKa = 5.6), which consequently results in the formation of strong and short hydrogen bonds with water molecules at the interface, and in-plane silanols with a pKa of 8.5, forming weak hydrogen bonds with the interfacial water molecules. Our estimate of the quartz point of zero charge (1.0) is found in good agreement with the experimental value of 1.9. We have also shown how the silanols orientation and their hydrogen bond properties are responsible for an amphoteric behavior of the surface. A detailed analysis has identified two species of adsorbed water molecules at the solid-liquid interface, which using the language of vibrational spectroscopy can be identified as ``liquid-like'' and ``ice-like'' water or, in other words, water molecules forming respectively weak and strong H-bonds with the oxide surface. These two populations of water are in turn responsible for two distinct peaks in the infrared spectrum of interfacial water and thus provide a molecular explanation of the experimental sum frequency generation spectrum recorded in the literature. In the specific case of quartz, we show that the liquid-/ice-like behavior is the result of the silanol groups ability to donate or accept hydrogen bonds with different strengths, which consequently modulates the vibrational properties of the adsorbed water layer.},

It is not only an indispensable component in the surface energy balance, but also an essential boundary condition in the coupled hydro-thermal-mechanical (HTM) numerical analysis of soil-atmosphere interaction. In this study, three G0 measurement methods (gradient method, calorimetric method and combination method) are evaluated based on the measurements (temperature, volumetric water content and thermal conductivity) using the actively heated distributed temperature sensing (AH-DTS) technology. In addition, through a series of in-situ tests, the feasibility of these methods is verified, and their applicability and application potential are compared and analyzed. The results indicate that the G0 values measured by the three AH-DTS technology-based methods are in the same order of magnitude, indicating that the three methods are feasible. Among them, the G0 measured by the gradient method is an instantaneous value which is closely related to the soil surface water content, while the G0 measured by the calorimetric method and combination method is an average values over a period of time. The gradient method is applicable for all types of soil, including the frozen soils. The calorimetric method and the combination method are suitable for soils of which water content can be measured by the AH-DTS sensor. It is recommended that an appropriate G0 measurement method based on the AH-DTS technology be selected according to the site situations.},

  abstract = {The rapid increase of the overall grain production of Argentina resulted with a storage capacity deficit in permanent structures of 40e50 million tons, and this context favored the rapid adoption of the silo bag technology. Silo bag allows differing grain selling from harvest time, taking advantage of the seasonal price changes and, hence, improving farmers' income. However, storing grain in silo bag could be risky if inadequate planning, handling or monitoring is implemented. Thus, the objective of this article was to develop a prediction model for soybean losses in silo bag storage based on monitoring CO2 concentration and other sensible variables. During 2013, an experiment was conducted in 13 soybean silo bags placed at farms and grain elevators in Balcarce area, South East of Buenos Aires province, Argentina, since May to December. Grain samples were collected and grain quality was evaluated. Storage variables, such as moisture content and interstitial atmosphere gas composition were also recorded, and at the end of storage, physical grain losses were quantified for each silo bag (kg of spoiled grain not commercialized). The results showed that there was not generalized quality loss in any silo bag, but localized losses were observed. These losses occurred due to water entrance in the silo bag through openings which resulted in spoiled grain from 140 to 4320 kg, representing from 0.07\% to 2.16\% in a 200 ton silo bag. Next, a correlation to predict grain losses was developed, which considered grain moisture and a predictor related to the CO2 concentration at the silo bag closing end as independent variables. This correlation explained 73\% of the grain losses variability, allowed to model different levels of losses, and was consistent with biological concepts.},

  abstract = {The vertical distribution of 137Cs in forest soil is important for predicting air dose rates and future cycling in forest ecosystems. However, there are many unexplained questions about the mechanisms of its downward migration. In this study, the 137Cs flux by rainfall infiltration was observed for three years from August 2017 using zero-tension lysimeters in a mature cedar forest where monitoring of the vertical distribution of 137Cs has been conducted since 2011. As a result, the 137Cs concentration in infiltrated water through the litter layer, 5 cm and 10 cm showed a tendency to be high in summer, but no such seasonal variation was found at 20 cm. Although the 137Cs inventory in the litter layer has been exponentially decreasing, the annual 137Cs fluxes in infiltrated water through the litter layer were almost the same in three years, and about 0.14--0.17\% of the deposition density of 137Cs. Comparing these 137Cs fluxes with the apparent amounts of downward migration of 137Cs estimated from the change in the vertical distribution of 137Cs, the contribution rate of the infiltrated water to downward migration of 137Cs from litter to soil was calculated to be 8.5--17.7\%. Similarly, the contribution rate in mineral soil layers was calculated to be 0.6--0.8\% on a measured basis and estimated to be 3.0 {\textpm} 0.2\% after correcting the amount of collected water, which is a problem with zerotension lysimeter. It indicates that rainfall infiltration can explain a small part of the downward migration of 137Cs, thus further studies are required to clarify the contribution rate of remaining mechanisms such as advectiondiffusion, colloidal transport, physical mixing, bioturbation, and growth and death of plant roots.},

A requisite component of carrying out such monitoring is the capability to numerically model the electromagnetic response of a set of source electrodes of finite length. We present a modelling algorithm using the finite-element method for calculating the electromagnetic response of a three-dimensional conductivity model excited using a vertical steel-cased borehole as a source. The method is based on a combination of the method of moments and the Coulomb-gauged primary--secondary potential formulation. Using the method of moments, we obtain the primary field in a half-space due to an energized vertical steel casing by dividing the casing into a set of segments, each assumed to carry a piecewise constant alternating current density. The primary field is then substituted into the primary--secondary potential finite-element formulation of the three-dimensional problem to obtain the secondary field. To validate the algorithm, we compare our numerical results with: (i) the analytical solution for an infinite length casing in a whole space, excited by a line source, and (ii) a three-layered Earth model without a casing. The agreement between the numerical and analytical solutions demonstrates the effectiveness of our algorithm. As an illustration, we also present the time-lapse electromagnetic response of a synthetic model representing a gas reservoir undergoing water flooding.},

We test the algorithm on synthetic data, and show its robustness for a noise level, typical of laboratory time domain measurements. We also show that, for the inversion purpose, the time domain data must be obtained with the different current wavelengths. We then test the algorithm on the experimental data recently obtained on brinesaturated medium-grained quartz sand (average grain diameter of 4 {\texttimes} 10-4 m), and on sand mixtures. For the medium-grained sand, relaxation time distribution contains a main peak at 25 s. Different amounts (3\%, 8\% and 12\%) of fine-grained quartz sand (average grain diameter of 1.12 {\texttimes} 10-4 m) were added to the medium-grained quartz sand. For the sand mixture, an additional peak is observed in the relaxation time distributions, in the time range from 1.0 to 2.5 s. The magnitude of the second peak increases with the increase of the fine-grained sand content. Therefore, the experimental data show that peaks in the relaxation time distributions are related to the grain size. On the basis of the known peak location, and of the known grain size value, we obtained the values of the diffusion coefficient, which were found to be of the same order of magnitude as those in the bulk solution.},

The data are compared on the basis of fitting model parameters: the chargeability, the time constant and the exponent. The difference between the above two equations (the Cole--Cole equation proposed by the Cole brothers and Pelton's equation) is manifested in one of the fitting parameters, the time constant. The Cole--Cole time constant is an inverse of the peak angular frequency of the imaginary conductivity, while Pelton's time constant depends on the chargeability and exponent values. The difference between the time constant values corresponding to the above two equations grows with the increase of the chargeability value, and with the decrease of the Cole--Cole exponent value. This issue must be taken into consideration when comparing the experimental data sets for high polarizability media presented in terms of the Cole--Cole parameters.},

  abstract = {Many studies on salinity stress assume that responses in hydroponics mimic those in soil. However, interactions between the soil solution and the soil matrix can affect responses to salinity stress. This study compared responses to salinity in hydroponics and soil, using two varieties of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). The responses to salinity caused by high concentrations of Na+ and Cl-- were compared to assess any consistent differences between hydroponics and soil associated with a cation and an anion that contribute to salinity stress. Concentrated nutrient solutions were also used to assess the effects of osmotic stress. The effects of salinity differed between the hydroponic and soil systems. Differences between barley cultivars in growth, tissue moisture content and ionic composition were not apparent in hydroponics, whereas significant differences occurred in soil. Growth reductions were greater under hydroponics than in soil at similar electrical conductivity values, and the uptake of Na+ and Cl-- was also greater. The relative importance of ion exclusion and osmotic stress varied. In soil, ion exclusion tended to be more important at low to moderate levels of stress (EC at field capacity up to 10 dS m--1) but osmotic stress became more important at higher stress levels. High external concentrations of Cl-- had similar adverse effects as high concentrations of Na+, suggesting that Cl-- toxicity may reduce growth. Fundamental differences in salinity responses appeared between soil and solution culture, and the importance of the different mechanisms of damage varies according to the severity and duration of the salt stress.},

The purpose of the standardized reference ET equation and calculation procedures is to bring commonality to the calculation of reference ET and to provide a standardized basis for determining or transferring crop coefficients for agricultural and landscape use. The basis of the standardized reference ET equation is the ASCE Penman-Monteith (ASCE-PM) method of ASCE Manual 70. For the standardization, the ASCE-PM method is applied for two types of reference surfaces representing clipped grass (a short, smooth crop) and alfalfa (a taller, rougher agricultural crop), and the equation is simplified to a reduced form of the ASCE--PM. Standardized calculations for vapor pressure, net radiation and wind speed adjustment are recommended for application to hourly and daily calculation time steps. Guidelines on assessing weather data integrity and estimating values for missing data are provided.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Permafrost soils are a critical component of the global carbon cycle and are locally important because they regulate the hydrologic flux from uplands to rivers. Furthermore, degradation of permafrost soils causes land surface subsidence, damaging infrastructure that is crucial for local communities. Regional and hemispherical maps of permafrost are too coarse to resolve distributions at a scale relevant to assessments of infrastructure stability or to illuminate geomorphic impacts of permafrost thaw. Here we train machine learning models to generate meter-scale maps of near-surface permafrost for three watersheds in the discontinuous permafrost region. The models were trained using ground truth determinations of near-surface permafrost presence from measurements of soil temperature and electrical resistivity. We trained three classifiers: extremely randomized trees (ERTr), support vector machines (SVM), and an artificial neural network (ANN). Model uncertainty was determined using k-fold cross validation, and the modeled extents of near-surface permafrost were compared to the observed extents at each site. At-a-site near-surface permafrost distributions predicted by the ERTr produced the highest accuracy (70\%--90\%). However, the transferability of the ERTr to the sites outside of the training data set was poor, with accuracies ranging from 50\% to 77\%. The SVM and ANN models had lower accuracies for at-a-site prediction (70\%--83\%), yet they had greater accuracy when transferred to the non-training site (62\%--78\%). These models demonstrate the potential for integrating high-resolution spatial data and machine learning models to develop maps of near-surface permafrost extent at resolutions fine enough to assess infrastructure vulnerability and landscape morphology influenced by permafrost thaw.           ,              Plain Language Summary             Accurate spatial assessments of the extent of near-surface permafrost in regions of discontinuous permafrost are essential for evaluating the potential impacts of permafrost thaw. Most current estimates of permafrost extent are provided at the scale of 10s of meters to kilometers, which is often too coarse to understand the impacts thaw might have on infrastructure or geomorphic processes. We trained machine learning models to generate maps of near-surface permafrost at 3~m spatial resolution in three sites in western Alaska. These maps provide an advancement in evaluating the extent of permafrost in the region as well as highlighting the landscape and ecological factors most important in driving predictions.           ,              Key Points                                                                High-resolution maps of near-surface permafrost on hillslopes were generated from machine learning models                                                     The normalized difference vegetation index was the most important feature in prediction of near-surface permafrost                                                     The support vector machines generally generated the highest balanced accuracy for predictions at sites where the model was not trained},

  abstract = {The cosmic-ray neutron sensor (CRNS), which estimates field scale soil water content, bridges the gap between point measurement and remote sensing. The accuracy of CRNS measurements, however, is affected by additional hydrogen pools (e.g., vegetation, snow, and rainfall interception). The objectives of this study are to: (i) evaluate the accuracy of CRNS estimates in a farmland system using depth and horizontal weighted point measurements, (ii) introduce a novel method for estimating the amounts of hydrogen from biomass and snow cover in CRNS data, and (iii) propose a simple approach for correcting the influences of aboveground hydrogen pool (expressed as aboveground water equivalent, AWE) on CRNS measurements. A field experiment was conducted in northeast China to compare soil water content results from CRNS to in-situ data with time domain reflectometry (TDR) and neutron probe (NP) in the 0--40 cm soil layers. The biomass water equivalent (BWE) and snow water equivalent (SWE) were observed to have separate linear relationships with the thermal/fast neutron ratio, and the dynamics of BWE and SWE were estimated correctly in the crop seasons and snow-covered seasons, respectively. A simple approach, which considered the AWE, AWE at calibration, and the effective measurement depth of CRNS, was introduced to correct the errors caused by BWE and SWE. After correction, the correlation coefficients between soil water contents determined by CRNS and TDR were 0.79 and 0.77 during the 2014 and 2015 crop seasons, respectively, and CRNS measurements had RMSEs of 0.028, 0.030, and 0.039 m3 m3 in the 2014 and 2015 crop seasons and the snow-covered seasons, respectively. The experimental results also indicated that the accuracies of CRNS estimated BWE and SWE were affected by the distributions of aboveground hydrogen pools, which were related to the height of the CRNS device above ground surface.},

Here we incorporate the regret theory of economics and decision science into the dynamic-adaptation-pathways framework and assess the impacts of high rates of changes on the flood defence systems in Shanghai. Specific options are developed to manage flooding on the Huangpu River from tidal water levels, river flows, rainfall, drainage inflows and combinations of these flood sources including sea level rises of up to 3\,m. Dynamic adaptation pathways are developed where the timing of tipping points from one intervention to the next depends on the actual changes in sea level, rainfall and other variables that affect the future design. This framework is potentially applicable for planning `no regrets' flood-defence systems in other low-lying coastal cities.},

Two test campaigns were conducted, on a test bench and on a sixteen stations machine, with the simultaneous acquisition of acceleration signals and load cell signals. A detailed sensitivity analysis based on experimental data, as many system parameters vary, has been developed. For the system modelling, a one Degree of Freedom (1 DoF) model, with lumped parameters and time-variant mass, including fluidic forces, was considered and numerically implemented. Genetic algorithms were used for the identification problems in the model-based analysis. The model allowed a deeper understanding of the phenomena that occur, showing promising results for the vibration prediction in a compensation process.},

Overall leaching could be minimized by exploiting such differences. Strontium bromide was uniformly applied to two, 7.2 by 6 m plots on Bosville fine sandy loam (fine, mixed, thermic Albaquic Paleudalf) planted in corn (lea mays L.) and soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.]. Within each plot, the surface soil texture varied from fine sandy loam to fine sandy clay loam. Soil water status was monitored with tensiometers. After the vegetative growth stage, soil samples were taken along five transects perpendicular to the crop rows at 0.2-m intervals, to a depth of 0.5 m. Sampling locations corresponded to row, quarterrow, and interrow positions. In the fine sandy loam half of the corn plot, there was significantly more leaching of Br below the 0.5-m depth in the interrow positions than in the row positions. This appears to be related to the soil water status, since soil conditions in the fine sandy loam half of the corn plot were, on the average, drier under row positions than under interrow positions. Overall leaching was less under soybean than under corn. Simplified two-dimensional simulations of solute transport in row-interrow zones further enhanced our understanding of the effects of net flux differences between those zones, overall net flux, and soil and crop type. The simulations indicated that overall leaching could be slowed by enhancing the differences in evapotranspiration between the row and interrow zones.},

In the proposed model, contacts of sand grains and intergrain solution-filled space are considered as electrical current passages of varying thickness, which differ in values of ion transport number. Ion-selective narrow passages are considered as active zones, large passages as passive. The proposed model describes spectral IP characteristics for the medium where the length of passive zones is much greater than the length of active ones. The model is called short narrow pores (SNP) model. The SNP model predicts a growth of IP time constant with increase of length of ion-selective zone. Both the time domain and frequency domain parameters are described. The parameters of Cole -- Cole model corresponding to the SNP model were also found. The behaviour of model parameters is compared with experimental data obtained on natural and sieved sands using time domain technique. The natural sand spectra correspond neither to the simple SNP model nor simple Cole -- Cole model with single time constant because the lengths of ion-selective zones vary, reflecting the grain-size distribution. The spectra of sieved sand compared with the theoretical SNP spectra reveal close correspondence between experimental data and theoretical parameters. For four sieved sands, both the theoretical and experimental data show that the time constant of the IP is proportional to the square of the average grain size.},

  abstract = {We studied the electrical induced polarization (IP) response of simple multiphase porous systems by conducting time-domain (TD) IP measurements on two different groups of sieved quartz samples: sands containing air in unsaturated pores and sands where the unsaturated pores were filled with kerosene. The analyzed chargeability vs. water content relationship showed an extreme behavior. The resistivity vs. water content relationship exhibited two distinct power law regions characterized by different values of the power-law exponents. Quartz--water--air and quartz--water--kerosene samples showed similar behavior. A conceptual model of polarizing cells is proposed to explain the observed IP phenomena. We consider a sequence of large and narrow passageways for electric current as the elementary polarizing cell. The polarization of the cell is related to the difference in effective radii of the passageways. In the saturated cell, the water-filling intergrain space is considered the large current passageway. Areas of grain contact are considered narrow passageways. In unsaturated cells, the thin water film on the grain surfaces is considered the narrow passageway. Areas of grain contact are viewed as large passageways. The polarization of unsaturated cells in this condition should be larger than that of saturated cells. With further drying, unsaturated cells start releasing water from the grain contact area, which leads to a convergence of the effective radii of large and narrow passageways and, consequently, to a decrease in cell polarization. The conceptual model is capable of explaining the observed dependence of polarization on water content. The chargeability maximum corresponds to the limit between the two distinct regions, each having a different resistivity vs. water content relationship, which we consider as the critical water content. Our model suggests that at the critical water content, pore water becomes predominantly adsorbed on the solid surface.},

  abstract = {Water shortages within the western USA are resulting in the adoption of water-saving agricultural practices within this region. Among the many possible methods for saving water in agriculture, the adoption of subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) provides a potential solution to the problem of low water use efficiency. Other advantages of SDI include reduced NO3 leaching compared to surface irrigation, higher yields, a dry soil surface for improved weed control, better crop health, and harvest flexibility for many specialty crops. The use of SDI also allows the virtual elimination of crop water stress, the ability to apply water and nutrients to the most active part of the root zone, protection of drip lines from damage due to cultivation and tillage, and the ability to irrigate with wastewater while preventing human contact. Yet, SDI is used only on a minority of cropland in the arid western USA. Reasons for the limited adoption of SDI include the high initial capital investment required, the need for intensive management, and the urbanization that is rapidly consuming farmland in parts of the western USA. The contributions of SDI to increasing yield, quality, and water use efficiency have been demonstrated. The two major barriers to SDI sustainability in arid regions are economics (i.e., paying for the SDI system), including the high cost of installation; and salt accumulation, which requires periodic leaching, specialized tillage methods, or transplanting of seedlings rather than direct-seeding. We will review advances in irrigation management with SDI.},

  abstract = {Measurement errors can play a pivotal role in geophysical inversion. Most inverse models require users to prescribe or assume a statistical model of data errors before inversion. Wrongly prescribed errors can lead to over- or under-fitting of data; however, the derivation of models of data errors is often neglected. With the heightening interest in uncertainty estimation within hydrogeophysics, better characterisation and treatment of measurement errors is needed to provide improved image appraisal. Here we focus on the role of measurement errors in electrical resistivity tomography (ERT). We have analysed two time-lapse ERT datasets: one contains 96 sets of direct and reciprocal data collected from a surface ERT line within a 24 h timeframe; the other is a two-year-long cross-borehole survey at a UK nuclear site with 246 sets of over 50,000 measurements. Our study includes the characterisation of the spatial and temporal behaviour of measurement errors using autocorrelation and correlation coefficient analysis. We find that, in addition to well-known proportionality effects, ERT measurements can also be sensitive to the combination of electrodes used, i.e. errors may not be uncorrelated as often assumed. Based on these findings, we develop a new error model that allows grouping based on electrode number in addition to fitting a linear model to transfer resistance. The new model explains the observed measurement errors better and shows superior inversion results and uncertainty estimates in synthetic examples. It is robust, because it groups errors together based on the electrodes used to make the measurements. The new model can be readily applied to the diagonal data weighting matrix widely used in common inversion methods, as well as to the data covariance matrix in a Bayesian inversion framework. We demonstrate its application using extensive ERT monitoring datasets from the two aforementioned sites.},

One promising noninvasive geoelectrical monitoring approach is spectral induced polarization (SIP). However, the roots' SIP signature is underexplored, not well understood, and a mechanistic model has not been proposed. Here, we developed a mechanistic model for SIP's response of roots, which is based on the Poisson-Nernst-Planck equation. The modeling results suggest that the magnitude of root polarization is linearly related to the root's external surface area and that the polarization length scale is the root's diameter. We suggest that injecting a current to the plant's stem results in higher polarization associated with the root-cells' total surface area. In this case, the polarization length scale is the cell diameter. Overall, we quantified the link between the root's dimensions and their electrical signature, which may inspire SIP application for root phenotyping.},

  abstract = {Microbial electrochemical technologies (MET) are increasingly being considered for environmental remediation applications, mainly for their unique capability to enhance microbial degradation processes in an environmen\- tally sustainable manner (e.g., without requiring addition of chemicals and with little or even no energy con\- sumption). To date, however, the application of MET for the remediation of saturated and unsaturated soils contaminated by petroleum hydrocarbons (PH) remains challenged by a number of environmental and opera\- tional factors which have, so far, hampered a more rapid deployment of the technology. In this context, this critical review has comprehensively analyzed the recent scientific literature dealing with electrobioremediation of PH-contaminated soils, in order to disentangle the impact of key process parameters (e.g., type of electrodes, system configurations, design criteria) and environmental conditions (e.g., soil characteristics and strategies to manipulate thereof, type of contaminants, composition of PH-degrading communities) on the overall remedia\- tion performance. Interestingly, the analysis revealed that MET-based soil electrobioremediation has been suc\- cessfully applied to remove a variety of PH (from alkanes to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and mixtures thereof) from soils displaying a broad range of electric conductivities (0.2--6 mS/cm), using different system configurations (from simple graphite rod buried within soils to more complex tubular electrode assemblies). To date, the limited radius-of-influence of electrodes buried in contaminated soils, which is typically lower than 50 cm, appears to be a main limiting factor which requires specific strategies (e.g., amendment of soil with conductive materials/minerals and/or surfactants) to be properly addressed. Finally, the study highlights the urgent need for pilot-scale testing to confirm the promising results obtained at the laboratory-scale under more controlled, yet often far-less representative, conditions as well as to catalyze the commercial and societal interest towards this novel technology.},

  abstract = {Landslides pose significant risks to communities and infrastructure, and mitigating these risks relies on understanding landslide causes and triggering processes. It has been shown that geophysical surveys can significantly contribute to the characterization of unstable slopes. However, hydrological processes can be temporally and spatially heterogeneous, requiring their related properties to be monitored over time. Geoelectrical monitoring can provide temporal and volumetric distributions of electrical resistivity, which are directly related to moisture content. To date, studies demonstrating this capability have been restricted to 2-D sections, which are insufficient to capture the full degree of spatial heterogeneity. This study is the first to employ 4-D (i.e., 3-D time lapse) resistivity imaging on an active landslide, providing long-term data (3 years) highlighting the evolution of moisture content prior to landslide reactivation and showing its decline post reactivation. Crucially, the time-lapse inversion methodology employed here incorporates movements of the electrodes on the unstable surface. Although seasonal characteristics dominate the shallow moisture dynamics during the first 2 years with surficial drying in summer and wetting in winter, in the months preceding reactivation, moisture content increased by more than 45\% throughout the slope. This is in agreement with independent data showing a significant rise in piezometric heads and shallow soil moisture contents as a result of prolonged and intense rainfall. Based on these results, remediation measures could be designed and early-warning systems implemented. Thus, resistivity monitoring that can allow for moving electrodes provides a new means for the effective mitigation of landslide risk.},

  abstract = {In this study, the use of electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) as a tool to guide ornamental stone extraction is investigated. ERT is not conventionally used in highly resistive environments, such as on rock faces, due to the high contact resistances that can impede current injection. Here, the challenges of conducting ERT in such environments are discussed and possible solutions suggested. For this, an example of the application of ERT in a deep and narrow marble quarry is used. The marble deposit is affected by fracturing and karstification. Due to the nature of these features, they present a significant resistivity contrast to the background resistivity of the marble and thus excellent targets to test the application of ERT. Their location was mapped using field observations and complementary ground penetrating radar data. By using an appropriate sensor deployment, a suitable resistivity meter, and advanced data processing routines, the derived 3D resistivity model is in good agreement with the independent observations. This shows that despite the challenges, ERT can be used as a non-invasive tool to obtain information on the stone properties prior to extraction. This will help in guiding quarry operations and will allow for a targeted, safe and efficient extraction of high quality stone, thereby increasing sustainability and economical competitiveness.},

Estimating bedrock hydraulic properties over watershed scales is inherently difficult, particularly in fracture-dominated regions. Our analysis tests the covariability of above- and belowground features on a watershed scale, by linking borehole geophysical data, near-surface geophysics, and remote sensing data. We use machine learning to quantify the relationships between bedrock geophysical/hydrological properties and geomorphological/vegetation indices and show that machine learning relationships can estimate most of their covariability. Although we can predict the electrical resistivity variation across the watershed, regions of lower variability in the input parameters are shown to provide better estimates, indicating a limitation of commonly applied geomorphological models. Our results emphasize that such an integrated approach can be used to derive detailed bedrock characteristics, allowing for identification of small-scale variations across an entire watershed that may be critical to assess the impact of disturbances on hydrological systems.           ,              Remote sensing data are used to predict bedrock properties by exploiting covariability of above- and belowground features.},

Using a network of soil moisture and temperature sensors, electrical resistivity tomography monitoring, and a weather station we assess the above and below-ground processes driving the hydrological response of a hillslope during snowmelt and summer monsoon. The transect covers bedrock and vegetation gradients, with a steep upper part characterized by shallow bedrock, and gentle lower part underlain by colluvium. The main vegetation cover is conifers on the upper, and grass and veratrum on the lower part. Combined with a simplified hydrological model, we show that the thin soil layer of the steep slope acts as a preferential flow path, leading to mostly shallow lateral flow, interrupted by vertical flow, mostly at tree locations, and likely facilitated by flow along fractures and roots. Vertical flow and upstream-driven groundwater dynamics are prevailing at the colluvium, presenting a very different hydrological behavior compared to the upper part.

Porous ceramic discs were used with existing laboratory IP instrumentation to permit accurate IP measurements on unsaturated samples. Polarization magnitude during evaporative drying approximates a power law dependence on saturation. Saturation exponents for the polarization term were consistently less than Archie conduction exponents, although no clear relationship between the exponents was observed. The polarization measured over a pressure drainage and imbibition cycle exhibits a complex (yet similar between tested samples) saturation dependence, being a function of saturation range and saturation history. Polarization is observed to increase with saturation over certain saturation intervals, yet decrease with saturation over others. High polarization observed during sample imbibition is consistent with a model for the development of a continuous charged air-fluid interface as previously proposed to explain hysteresis in resistivity measurements. The saturation dependence of the phase angle measured in IP in large part results from changes in conduction as pores fill and drain. Models of low-frequency polarization based on grainsize-controlled and pore-size-controlled relaxation both support dependence of IP measurements on saturation. Our results suggest that saturation dependent polarization must be considered for effective interpretation of IP measurements from the vadose zone.},

Fruit yield, leaf water potential (LWP), and soil water depletion (SWD) were measured among trees from each treatment. Actual evapotranspiration was calculated in 3 ways, using 2 energy balance methods (eddy correlation and Bowen's ratio) and water balance. Evapotranspiration rates of I70 and I50 treatments were 10\% and 18\% less than I100, respectively. Average irrigation amount for I50 was less than half of the average irrigation amount for I100. Considering that yield for the experimental treatments did not change statistically significantly, the I50 treatment provided about 50\% more irrigation water savings than full irrigation conditions. Grapefruit tree LWP was highly correlated to soil water status and significantly associated with irrigation treatment. Average LWP values for treatments were --2.70 MPa for I100, --2.96 MPa for I70, and --3.28 MPa for I50. LWP increased up to a threshold level equivalent to 60\%--66\% of SWD, above which LWP decreased linearly with a continuous increase of SWD. This indicates that an average LWP of --3.28 MPa can be allowed for grapefruit under these experimental conditions while keeping the crop yield at that of full irrigation levels. The research findings showed that an enhanced understanding of physiological parameters is essential for irrigation scheduling of fruit plants. These will result in obtaining the optimum yield of fruit while conserving water.},

  abstract = {Several electrical methods have been introduced as non-invasive techniques to overcome the limited accessibility to root systems. Among them, the earth impedance method (EIM) represents the most recent development. Applying an electrical field between a cormus and the rooted soil, the EIM measures the absorptive root surface area (ARSA) from grounding resistance patterns. Allometric relationships suggested that this method was a valuable tool. Crucial assumptions for the applicability of the EIM, however, have not been tested experimentally. Focusing on tree root systems, the present study assesses the applicability of the EIM. Six hypotheses, deduced from the EIM approach, were tested in several experiments and the results were compared with conventional methods. None of the hypotheses could be verified and the results allow two major conclusions. First, in terms of an analogue electrical circuit, a tree-root--soil continuum appears as a serial circuit with xylem and soil resistance being the dominant components. Allometric variation in contact resistance, with the latter being the proxy for root surface area, are thus overruled by the spatial and seasonal variation of soil and xylem resistances. Second, in a tree-root--soil continuum, distal roots conduct only a negligible portion of the electric charge. Most of charge carriers leave the root system in the proximal parts of the root--soil interface.},

Although soil is a non-renewable natural resource, humans have increasingly used it as a contaminant sink ever since the Industrial Revolution. Pollution endangers natural soil mechanisms that allow the soil to keep itself in balance and compromises the supply of soil-based goods and services. Detrimental effects of contaminants on soil microbiota may be directly related to loss of biodiversity and functions such as the recycling of nutrients. However, this direct negative effect is still debated among microbial ecologists because microbial communities may be surprisingly resilient (i.e. able to recover from contamination effects) and/or functionally redundant. Likewise, the potential toxicity of soil contamination to humans is controversial as investigations on the mix of different contaminants are very limited. Due to accumulated evidence of the potential toxicity of single contaminants on human health and animals, mostly based on in vitro or in vivo assays, international guidelines, such as the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, have established a list of priority contaminants. Despite worldwide concern about soil contamination, Europe still lacks a common soil legislative tool because the proposed Soil Directive Framework is currently under negotiation. The lack of a European directive is nevertheless compensated by national policies at the member state level.},

Then predictions of single and multiphase properties are made with no further adjustment of the model. We successfully predict relative permeability and oil recovery for water wet, oil wet, and mixed wet data sets. For water flooding we introduce a method for assigning contact angles to match measured wettability indices. The aim of this work is not simply to match experiments but to use easily acquired data to predict difficult to measure properties. Furthermore, the variation of these properties in the field, due to wettability trends and different pore structures, can now be predicted reliably.},

Ecosystem health has been defined in terms of ecosystem stability and resilience in response to a disturbance or stress. We therefore, suggest that indicators for soil health could be found by monitoring responses of the soil microbial community to the application of different stress factors at various intensities. The amplitude of a response and time to return to the current state before application of stress could serve as measures of soil health. Root pathogens are an integral part of soil microbial communities, and the occurrence of epiphytotics forms an indication of an ecosystem in distress. Disease suppression can be viewed as a manifestation of ecosystem stability and health. Thus, indicators for soil health could possibly also function as indicators for disease suppressiveness. Previously suggested indicators for soil health and disease suppression have mainly been lists of variables that were correlated to more or less disturbed soils (ranging from conventional to organic agricultural soils, grassland and forest soils) or to conduciveness to disease. We suggest a systematic ecological approach to the search for indicators for soil health and disease suppression, namely, measuring biological responses to various stress factors and the time needed to return to the current state. {\copyright} 2000 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

  abstract = {The study aims to identify the responses of citrus orchards (C. sinensis (L.) Osbeck), grown under typical Mediterranean climatic conditions, to deficit irrigation (DI) regimes applied over more than a decade (2010-2020). In particular, the DI regimes were declined at the study site in terms of sustained deficit irrigation, regulated deficit irrigation, partial drying of the root-zone, with increasing severity of the water deficit, from 25\% to 50\% of the crop evapotranspiration, using surface and sub-surface micro-irrigation techniques. Long-term monitoring was set up for identifying the main processes acting at the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum (SPAC) level through direct in situ measurements of mass and energy fluxes (i.e., via micrometeorological technique) and the estimation of ETc and transpiration fluxes (i.e., via sap flow method), and the soil-plant-water processes (via geoelectrical techniques). In addition, the main physiological, qualitative, and quantitative parameters were evaluated since the beginning of the experiment. The results of the long-term experiment demonstrated the great adaptability of the crop species to sustain even the highest water reductions without substantial alterations of the main marketable productive and qualitative characteristics, evidencing the importance of controlling the SPAC dynamics for correctly applying the water restriction regimes.},

  abstract = {The use of hydrogeophysical methods provides insights for supporting optimal irrigation design and management. In the present study, the electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) was applied for monitoring the soil water motion patterns resulting from the adoption of water deficit scenarios in a micro-irrigated orange orchard (Eastern Sicily, Italy). The relationship of ERI with independent ancillary data of soil water content (SWC), plant transpiration (T) and in situ measurements of hydraulic conductivity at saturation (Ks, i.e., using the falling head method, FH) was evaluated. The soil water motion patterns and the maximum wet depths in the soil profile identified by ERI were quite dependent on SWC (R2 = 0.79 and 0.82, respectively). Moreover, ERI was able to detect T in the severe deficit irrigation treatment (electrical resistivity increases of about 20\%), whereas this phenomenon was masked at higher SWC conditions. Ks rates derived from ERI and FH approaches revealed different patterns and magnitudes among the irrigation treatments, as consequence of their different measurement scales and the methodological specificity. Finally, ERI has been proved suitable for identifying the soil wetting/drying patterns and the geometrical characteristics of wet bulbs, which represent some of the most influential variables for the optimal design and management of micro-irrigation systems.},

In this context, the geophysical monitoring based on direct current methods (such as the Electrical Resistivity Tomography, ERT) can help to detect the soil heterogeneity by exploring the soil water variability. ERT time-lapse surveys were carried out in almond orchards characterized by different soil types in terms of structure (i.e. layered, light and heavy soil profiles) and texture features (i.e. prevalently clay loam versus sandy clay loam). Specifically, two-dimensional ERT surveys were combined with the monitoring of multiple soil-plant-atmosphere factors, including the components of the surface energy balance using an eddy covariance system, the soil moisture and the plant water status measured using a neutron probe and pressure chamber measurements, respectively. The interpretation of the ERT results together with the ancillary data has provided spatially and temporally distributed information about the soil water processes that occurred within the almond root-zone during irrigation, allowing us to identify where the most root-water uptake occurs and the delineation of the irrigation wet bulbs under micro-irrigations conditions.},

Much progress has been attained in the analytical and numerical description of vadose zone transfer processes. A variety of deterministic models are currently available for describing and predicting these processes. The most popular ones continue to be the classical Richards equation for unsaturated flow and the Fickian-based convection-dispersion equation for solute transport. While deterministic solutions of these equations remain useful tools in research and management, their practical utility for predicting actual field water and solute concentration is increasingly being questioned. Problems caused by preferential flow through soil macropores and by spatial and temporal variability in soil hydraulic properties have caused some disillusionment with the classical models. A number of alternative deterministic and stochastic formulations have been proposed to specifically deal with preferential flow and/or spatial variability. Those models have greatly increased our understanding of field scale transport processes, and have in some cases led to better practical tools for management purposes.},

  abstract = {Soil, through its various functions, plays a vital role in the Earth's ecosystems and provides multiple ecosystem services to humanity. Pedotransfer functions (PTFs) are simple to complex knowledge rules that relate available soil information to soil properties and variables that are needed to parameterize soil processes. In this paper, we review the existing PTFs and document the new generation of PTFs developed in the different disciplines of Earth system science. To meet the methodological challenges for a successful application in Earth system modeling, we emphasize that PTF development has to go hand in hand with suitable extrapolation and upscaling techniques such that the PTFs correctly represent the spatial heterogeneity of soils. PTFs should encompass the variability of the estimated soil property or process, in such a way that the estimation of parameters allows for validation and can also confidently provide for extrapolation and upscaling purposes capturing the spatial variation in soils. Most actively pursued recent developments are related to parameterizations of solute transport, heat exchange, soil respiration, and organic carbon content, root density, and vegetation water uptake. Further challenges are to be addressed in parameterization of soil erosivity and land use change impacts at multiple scales. We argue that a comprehensive set of PTFs can be applied throughout a wide range of disciplines of Earth system science, with emphasis on land surface models. Novel sensing techniques provide a true breakthrough for this, yet further improvements are necessary for methods to deal with uncertainty and to validate applications at global scale. Plain Language Summary For the application of pedotransfer functions in current Earth system models, and specifically for the different fluxes of water, solutes, and gas between soil and atmosphere, subject of the land surface models, recent developments of knowledge are entered in a new generation of pedotransfer functions. Methods for development and evaluation of pedotransfer functions are described in this comprehensive review, and perspectives for future developments in different Earth system science disciplines are presented. Challenges are still present for the application in some extreme environments of the Earth. We argue that a comprehensive set of pedotransfer functions can be applied throughout a wide range of disciplines of Earth system science, with emphasis on land surface models. Even though methodological challenges are still present for extrapolation and scaling, as outlined, integration and validation in global-scale models is an achievable goal.},

  abstract = {Complex resistivity spectra, in the frequency range 0.001 to 10 hz, have been obtained through computer analysis of waveforms tape recorded at porphyry copper deposits. When care is taken to avoid distortions caused by the geometric effects of electrical inhomogeneities, the spectra of typical porphyry copper mineralization are remarkably uniform in character. The geometric effects of veins, which generally complicate the response of hand samples, can be reduced through in-situ measurements using electrode separations of a few meters. In the frequency range of interest for inducedpolarization (IP) exploration, the observed spectra are accurately described by [Formula: see text] where K is a constant and b is a positive fraction. The fraction b has a value less than 0.1 and is a complete measure of IP. In the frequency range of interest, Laplace transformation gives the step response to be approximated by [Formula: see text] Typical current waveforms used in IP prospecting can be synthesized by superposition of steps. Using these frequency and time response functions, percent frequency effect, phase, and pulse-transient parameters are compared as measures of IP. By using a volume distribution function, it is shown that a distribution of lossy capacitors will explain the observed response. Physically, this might correspond to the double-layer capacitance of metallic particles in mineralized rock.},

In order to investigate this further, we constructed a strain of               G. sulfurreducens               , designated Aro-5, which produced pili with diminished conductivity. This was accomplished by modifying the amino acid sequence of PilA, the structural pilin protein. An alanine was substituted for each of the five aromatic amino acids in the carboxyl terminus of PilA, the region in which               G. sulfurreducens               PilA differs most significantly from the PilAs of microorganisms incapable of long-range extracellular electron transport. Strain Aro-5 produced pili that were properly decorated with the multiheme               c               -type cytochrome OmcS, which is essential for Fe(III) oxide reduction. However, pili preparations of the Aro-5 strain had greatly diminished conductivity and Aro-5 cultures were severely limited in their capacity to reduce Fe(III) compared to the control strain. Current production of the Aro-5 strain, with a graphite anode serving as the electron acceptor, was less than 10\% of that of the control strain. The conductivity of the Aro-5 biofilms was 10-fold lower than the control strain's. These results demonstrate that the pili of               G. sulfurreducens               must be conductive in order for the cells to be effective in extracellular long-range electron transport.                                         IMPORTANCE               Extracellular electron transfer by               Geobacter               species plays an important role in the biogeochemistry of soils and sediments and has a number of bioenergy applications. For example, microbial reduction of Fe(III) oxide is one of the most geochemically significant processes in anaerobic soils, aquatic sediments, and aquifers, and               Geobacter               organisms are often abundant in such environments.               Geobacter sulfurreducens               produces the highest current densities of any known pure culture, and close relatives are often the most abundant organisms colonizing anodes in microbial fuel cells that harvest electricity from wastewater or aquatic sediments. The finding that a strain of               G. sulfurreducens               that produces pili with low conductivity is limited in these extracellular electron transport functions provides further insight into these environmentally significant processes.                        ,                             Extracellular electron transfer by               Geobacter               species plays an important role in the biogeochemistry of soils and sediments and has a number of bioenergy applications.

  abstract = {Low-frequency dielectric spectroscopy can be measured in terms of a conductance and a phase lag between the electrical current and the electrical field. This conductance and phase lag can be written as into a complex conductivity with both an in-phase and quadrature components that are frequency dependent. In sands, the low-frequency (10 mHz--40 kHz) spectra of the complex conductivity are dominated by the polarization of the electrical double layer (especially the internal part of the electrical double layer called the Stern layer) and the Maxwell--Wagner polarization (typically above 100 Hz). We present a polarization that is able to explain the complex conductivity spectra including the grain size distribution, the porosity, and the complexation of the mineral surface with the ions of the pore water. To test this model, we investigate the sorption of various cations (Na, Pb, Zn) characterized by different affinities with the surface of silica. Sand column experiments were carried out to see the change in the complex conductivity during the advective/dispersive transport of a lead nitrate solution and a zinc sulfate solution, replacing a sodium chloride solution in the pore space of the sand. The complex conductivity model is able to explain the change of the phase over time.},

During the removal process, batch technique is used, and the effects of pH, clay amount, heavy metal concentration and agitation time on adsorption efficiency are studied. Langmuir, Freundlich and Dubinin--Radushkevich (D--R) isotherms are applied in order to determine the efficiency of natural clay used as an adsorbent. Results show that all isotherms are linear. It is determined that adsorption of Cu2+ and Zn2+ is well-fitted by the second order reaction kinetic. In addition, calculated and experimental heavy metal amounts adsorbed by the unit clay mass are too close to each other. It is concluded that natural clay can be used as an effective adsorbent for removing Cu2+ and Zn2+ from aqueous solutions.},

In this paper we predict this relationship by stochastic analysis of the unsaturated Brooks-Corey flow in heterogeneous soils. Using sensitivity analysis, we show that parameters of the moisture retention characteristic and their spatial variability determine to a large extent the shape of the soil moisture variance-mean water content function. We demonstrate that soil hydraulic properties and their variability can be inversely estimated from spatially distributed measurements of soil moisture content. Predicting this relationship for eleven textural classes we found that the standard deviation of soil moisture peaked between 0.17 and 0.23 for most textural classes. It was found that the               {$\beta$}               parameter, which describes the pore-size distribution of soils, controls the maximum value of the soil moisture standard deviation.},

  abstract = {This review covers, in a comprehensive manner, the approaches available in the literature to upscale soil water processes and hydraulic parameters in the vadose zone. We distinguish two categories of upscaling methods: forward approaches requiring information about the spatial distribution of hydraulic parameters at a small scale, and inverse modeling approaches requiring information about the spatial and temporal variation of state variables at various scales, including so-called ``soft data''. Geostatistical and scaling approaches are crucial to upscale soil water processes and to derive large-scale effective fluxes and parameters from small-scale information. Upscaling approaches include stochastic perturbation methods, the scaleway approach, the stream-tube approach, the aggregation concept, inverse modeling approaches, and data fusion. With all upscaling methods, the estimated effective parameters depend not only on the properties of the heterogeneous flow field but also on boundary conditions. The use of the Richards equation at the field and watershed scale is based more on pragmatism than on a sound physical basis. There are practically no data sets presently available that provide sufficient information to extensively validate existing upscaling approaches. Use of numerical case studies has therefore been most common. More recently and still under development, hydrogeophysical methods combined with ground-based remote sensing techniques promise significant contributions toward providing high-quality data sets. Finally, most of the upscaling literature in vadose zone research has dealt with bare soils or deep vadose zones. There is a need to develop upscaling methods for real world soils, considering root water uptake mechanisms and other soil--plant--atmosphere interactions.},

We highlight and review the state of the art in using soil moisture measurements for (1) estimation of soil hydraulic properties, (2) quantification of water and energy fluxes, and (3) retrieval of spatial and temporal dynamics of soil moisture profiles. We argue for the urgent need to have access to field monitoring sites and databases that include detailed information about variability of hydrological fluxes and parameters, including their upscaled values. In addition, improved data assimilation methods are needed that fully exploit the information contained in soil moisture data. The development of novel upscaling methods for predicting effective moisture fluxes and disaggregation schemes toward integrating large-scale soil moisture measurements in hydrological models will increase the value of soil moisture measurements. Finally, we recognize a need to develop strategies that combine hydrogeophysical measurement techniques with remote sensing methods.},

Analysis of literature data showed that the moisture retention characteristic (MRC) parameterization by setting shape parameters               m               = 1 - 1/               n               produced the largest deviations between fitted and measured water contents for pressure head values between 330 (log               10               pressure head [pF] 2.5) and 2500 cm (pF 3.4). The Schaap--van Genuchten model performed best in describing the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity,               K               The classical VGM model using fixed parameters produced increasingly higher root mean squared residual, RMSR, values when the soil became drier. The most accurate PTFs for estimating the MRC were obtained when using textural properties, bulk density, soil organic matter, and soil moisture content. The RMSR values for these PTFs approached those of the direct fit, thus suggesting a need to improve both PTFs and the MRC parameterization. Inclusion of the soil water content in the PTFs for               K               only marginally improved their prediction compared with the PTFs that used only textural properties and bulk density. Including soil organic matter to predict               K               had more effect on the prediction than including soil moisture. To advance the development of PTFs, we advocate the establishment of databases of soil hydraulic properties that (i) are derived from standardized and harmonized measurement procedures, (ii) contain new predictors such as soil structural properties, and (iii) allow the development of time-dependent PTFs. Successful use of structural properties in PTFs will require parameterizations that account for the effect of structural properties on the soil hydraulic functions.},

We set up a laboratory experiment to quantify and disentangle the effect of Alnus incana roots on soil permeability and aggregate stability. Plants were grown in pots in a climate chamber for four different growing periods (1, 2, 4 and 8 months). Pots were filled with a soil coming from a moraine of a landslide area in Central Switzerland. After each growing period, surface permeability, soil volume permeability and soil aggregate stability were measured together with the development of the root systems. Our results show that alder roots significantly improve both surface and whole soil volume permeability already after 2 months of growth. Nevertheless, an increase in root length density does not necessarily correspond to an increase in permeability. We could set as a threshold a root length density of 0.1 cm/cm3 until which an increase in root development corresponds to an increase in soil permeability, whereas after this threshold we observed a decrease in soil permeability. A significant increase in soil aggregate stability could be observed only with a root length density of 2 cm/cm3. No obvious correlation between soil permeability and aggregate stability could be found. Future work should validate these laboratory results with field data.

These events have highlighted, once again, the need to take prevention measures in order to mitigate the damage that similar future events could inflict on the Italian social and economic system. As the costs of these measures might be very high, available resources should be allocated carefully, assigning priority to areas with the highest potential risk. Therefore, estimating the potential damage caused by events expected both in the near future and on a longer timescale in a reliable way might be an important tool for pursuing an effective prevention policy. The growing diversification and extent of urbanised areas and economic activities make the estimation of the above effects increasingly complex. Hence, reliance should be made on a combination of disciplines that may be very different from or that have often developed independently of one another over the years. However, this combination has resulted in discre-pancies in methodological approaches, which have impaired the effectiveness of communication to the authorities in char-ge of prevention policies},

  abstract = {Abstract                            For the first time, we combine depth-specific soil information obtained from the quantitative inversion of ground-based multicoil electromagnetic induction data with the airborne hyperspectral vegetation mapping of 1~{\texttimes}~1-m pixels including Sun-induced fluorescence (               F               ) to understand how subsurface structures drive above-surface plant performance. Hyperspectral data were processed to quantitative               F               and selected biophysical canopy maps, which are proxies for actual photosynthetic rates. These maps showed within-field spatial patterns, which were attributed to paleo-river channels buried at around 1-m depth. The soil structures at specific depths were identified by quantitative electromagnetic induction data inversions and confirmed by soil samples. Whereas the upper plowing layer showed minor correlation to the plant data, the deeper subsoil carrying vital plant resources correlated substantially. Linking depth-specific soil information with plant performance data may greatly improve our understanding and the modeling of soil-vegetation-atmosphere exchange processes.                        ,              Plain Language Summary             Plants interact with soil. This is intuitive, although we know little about the subsurface structure because we cannot see it. At first glance, all soil may look the same, yet healthy plants can survive beside withered ones. We investigate the soil-plant interaction in an agricultural field situated in an area characterized by ancient (paleo-) river channels. These channels formed in sandy-gravelly material due to melting water after last glaciation, were then filled up with fine aeolien sediments, overlaid with soils up to 1~m thick, and are no longer visible at the surface. However, crops grow in meandering/braiding patterns that can be seen on satellite images, for example. To explain this, the subsurface structural geometry must be known. We combine ground-based electromagnetic induction data inversion results with airborne hyperspectral measurements to reveal the soil depths driving plant performance (photosynthetic activity and growth). Contrary to expectations, the deeper subsoil and not the plowing layer controls plant performance at the investigated site. Plants above the buried paleoriver channels find nutrients and water, whereas the surrounding plants in gravelly soil suffer, especially during drought. These results improve our understanding of soil-plant interaction, which may improve soil-vegetation-atmosphere exchange process modeling and harvest predictability.           ,              Key Points                                                                Soil structures at depth were obtained by quantitative 3-D electromagnetic induction data inversions not by apparent electrical conductivity maps                                                     Deeper subsoil characteristics correlate with airborne Sun-induced fluorescence data indicating soil moisture effects on plant performance                                                     Quantitative inverted electrical conductivity model together with plant data help to inform and improve soil-vegetation-atmosphere models},

  abstract = {Multi-coil electromagnetic induction (EMI) systems induce magnetic fields below and above the subsurface. The resulting magnetic field is measured at multiple coils increasingly separated from the transmitter in a rigid boom. This field relates to the subsurface apparent electrical conductivity ({$\sigma$}a), and {$\sigma$}a represents an average value for the depth range investigated with a specific coil separation and orientation. Multi-coil EMI data can be inverted to obtain layered bulk electrical conductivity models. However, above-ground stationary influences alter the signal and the inversion results can be unreliable. This study proposes an improved data processing chain, including EMI data calibration, conversion, and inversion. For the calibration of {$\sigma$}a, three direct current resistivity techniques are compared: Electrical resistivity tomography with Dipole-Dipole and Schlumberger electrode arrays and vertical electrical soundings. All three methods obtained robust calibration results. The Dipole-Dipole-based calibration proved stable upon testing on different soil types. To further improve accuracy, we propose a non-linear exact EMI conversion to convert the magnetic field to {$\sigma$}a. The complete processing workflow provides accurate and quantitative EMI data and the inversions reliable estimates of the intrinsic electrical conductivities. This improves the ability to combine EMI with, e.g., remote sensing,~and the use of EMI for monitoring purposes.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Detailed knowledge of the intra-field variability of soil properties and crop characteristics is indispensable for the establishment of sustainable precision agriculture. We present an approach that combines ground-based agrogeophysical soil and aerial crop data to delineate field-specific management zones that we interpret with soil attribute measurements of texture, bulk density, and soil moisture, as well as yield and nitrate residue in the soil after potato (               Solanum tuberosum               L.) cultivation. To delineate the management zones, we use aerial drone-based normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), spatial electromagnetic induction (EMI) soil scanning, and the EMI--NDVI data combination as input in a machine learning clustering technique. We tested this approach in three successive years on six agricultural fields (two per year). The field-scale EMI data included spatial soil information of the upper 0--50~cm, to approximately match the soil depth sampled for attribute measurements. The NDVI measurements over the growing season provide information on crop development. The management zones delineated from EMI data outperformed the management zones derived from NDVI in terms of spatial coherence and showed differences in properties relevant for agricultural management: texture, soil moisture deficit, yield, and nitrate residue. The combined EMI--NDVI analysis provided no extra benefit. This underpins the importance of including spatially distributed soil information in crop data interpretation, while emphasizing that high-resolution soil information is essential for variable rate applications and agronomic modeling.                        ,              Core Ideas                                                                Electromagnetic induction (EMI) enables delineation of high-resolution management zones.

  abstract = {Movement of soil moisture associated with tree root-water uptake is ecologically important but technically challenging to measure. Here, the self-potential (SP) method, a passive electrical geophysical method, is used to characterize water flow in situ. Unlike tensiometers, which use a measurement of state (i.e., matric pressure) at two locations to infer fluid flow, the SP method directly measures signals generated by water movement. We collected SP measurements in a two-dimensional array at the base of a Douglas-fir tree (Pseudotsuga menziesii) in the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest in western Oregon over 5 months to provide insight on the propagation of transpiration signals into the subsurface under variable soil moisture. During dry conditions, SP data appear to show downward unsaturated flow, whereas nearby tensiometer data appear to suggest upward flow during this period. After the trees enter dormancy in the fall, precipitation-induced vertical flow dominates in the SP and tensiometer data. Diel variations in SP data correspond to periods of tree transpiration. Changes in volumetric water content occurring from soil moisture movement during transpiration are not large enough to appear in volumetric water content data. Fluid flow and electrokinetic coupling (i.e., electrical potential distribution) were simulated using COMSOL Multiphysics to explore the system controls on field data. The coupled model, which included a root-water uptake term, reproduced components of both the long-term and diel variations in SP measurements, thus indicating that SP has potential to provide spatially and temporally dense measurements of transpiration-induced changes in water flow. This manuscript presents the first SP measurements focusing on the movement of soil moisture in response to tree transpiration.},

  abstract = {Robust evapotranspiration (ET) models are required to predict water usage in a variety of terrestrial ecosystems under different geographical and agrometeorological conditions. As a result, several remote sensing-based surface energy balance (SEB) models have been developed to estimate ET over large regions. However, comparison of the performance of several SEB models at the same site is limited. In addition, none of the SEB models have been evaluated for their ability to predict ET in rain-fed high biomass sorghum grown for biofuel production. In this paper, we evaluated the performance of five widely used single-source SEB models, namely Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL), Mapping ET with Internalized Calibration (METRIC), Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS), Simplified Surface Energy Balance Index (S-SEBI), and operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop), for estimating ET over a high biomass sorghum field during the 2012 and 2013 growing seasons. The predicted ET values were compared against eddy covariance (EC) measured ET (ETEC) for 19 cloud-free Landsat image. In general, S-SEBI, SEBAL, and SEBS performed reasonably well for the study period, while METRIC and SSEBop performed poorly. All SEB models substantially overestimated ET under extremely dry conditions as they underestimated sensible heat (H) and overestimated latent heat (LE) fluxes under dry conditions during the partitioning of available energy. METRIC, SEBAL, and SEBS overestimated LE regardless of wet or dry periods. Consequently, predicted seasonal cumulative ET by METRIC, SEBAL, and SEBS were higher than seasonal cumulative ETEC in both seasons. In contrast, S-SEBI and SSEBop substantially underestimated ET under too wet conditions, and predicted seasonal cumulative ET by S-SEBI and SSEBop were lower than seasonal cumulative ETEC in the relatively wetter 2013 growing season. Our results indicate the necessity of inclusion of soil moisture or plant water stress component in SEB models for the improvement of their performance, especially under too dry or wet environments.},

  abstract = {Crosshole resistivity tomography has received consideration as a tool for quantitative imaging of carbon dioxide stored in deep saline aquifers. With regard to the monitoring responsibility of site operators and the substantial expenses associated with permanent downhole installations, optimized experimental design gains particular importance. Based on an iterative appraisal of the formal model resolution matrix, we developed a method to estimate optimum electrode locations along the borehole trajectories with the objective to maximize the imaging capability within a prescribed target horizon. For the presented crosshole case, these layouts were found to be symmetric, exhibiting refined electrode spacings within the target horizon. Our results revealed that a sparse but well conceived set of electrodes can provide a large part of the information content offered by comparably dense electrode distributions. In addition, the optimized layout outperformed equidistant setups with the same number of electrodes because its resolution was focused on the monitoring target. The optimized electrode layouts presented provided a powerful and cost-efficient opportunity to complement permanent installations, particularly at, but not limited to, future [Formula: see text] storage sites. Although preliminarily developed to support the design of crosshole resistivity layouts, our approach is directly applicable to other survey geometries including surface and surface-to-hole acquisitions.},

  abstract = {In floodplain environments, a naturally reduced zone (NRZ) is considered to be a common biogeochemical hot spot, having distinct microbial and geochemical characteristics. Although important for understanding their role in mediating floodplain biogeochemical processes, mapping the subsurface distribution of NRZs over the dimensions of a floodplain is challenging, as conventional wellbore data are typically spatially limited and the distribution of NRZs is heterogeneous. In this study, we present an innovative methodology for the probabilistic mapping of NRZs within a three-dimensional (3-D) subsurface domain using induced polarization imaging, which is a noninvasive geophysical technique. Measurements consist of surface geophysical surveys and drilling-recovered sediments at the U.S. Department of Energy field site near Rifle, CO (USA). Inversion of surface time domain-induced polarization (TDIP) data yielded 3-D images of the complex electrical resistivity, in terms of magnitude and phase, which are associated with mineral precipitation and other lithological properties. By extracting the TDIP data values colocated with wellbore lithological logs, we found that the NRZs have a different distribution of resistivity and polarization from the other aquifer sediments. To estimate the spatial distribution of NRZs, we developed a Bayesian hierarchical model to integrate the geophysical and wellbore data. In addition, the resistivity images were used to estimate hydrostratigraphic interfaces under the floodplain. Validation results showed that the integration of electrical imaging and wellbore data using a Bayesian hierarchical model was capable of mapping spatially heterogeneous interfaces and NRZ distributions thereby providing a minimally invasive means to parameterize a hydrobiogeochemical model of the floodplain.},

  abstract = {Satellite remote sensing is a promising technique for estimating global or regional evapotranspiration (ET). A simple and accurate method is essential when estimating ET using remote sensing data. Such a method is investigated by taking advantage of satellite measurements and the extensive ground-based measurements available at eight enhanced surface facility sites located throughout the Southern Great Plains (SGP) area of the United States from January 2002 to May 2005. Data analysis shows that correlation coefficients between ET and surface net radiation are the highest, followed by temperatures (air temperature or land surface temperature,               T                                s                              ), and vegetation indices (enhanced vegetation index (EVI) or normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)). A simple regression equation is proposed to estimate ET using surface net radiation, air or land surface temperatures and vegetation indices. ET can be estimated using daytime-averaged air temperature and EVI with a root mean square error (RMSE) of {$\sim$}30 W m               -2               and a correlation coefficient of 0.91 across all sites and years. ET can also be estimated with comparable accuracy using NDVI and               T                                s                              . More importantly, the daytime-averaged ET can also be estimated using only one measurement per day of temperatures (the daytime maximum air temperature or               T                                s                              ) with comparable accuracy. A sensitivity analysis shows that the proposed method is only slightly sensitive to errors of temperatures, vegetation indices and net surface radiation. An independent validation was made using the measurements colleted by the eddy covariance method at six AmeriFlux sites throughout the United States from 2001 to 2006. The land cover associated with the AmeriFlux sites varies from grassland, to cropland and forest. The results show that ET can be reasonably predicted with a correlation coefficient that varies from 0.84 to 0.95 and a bias that varies from 3 W m               -2               to 15 W m               -2               and RMSE varying from {$\sim$}30 W m               -2               to {$\sim$}40 W m               -2               . The positive bias partly comes from the energy imbalance problem encountered in the eddy covariance method. The proposed method can predict ET under a wide range of soil moisture contents and land cover types.},

The electrochemical boundary condition is solved by considering both the chemical equilibrium on solid--liquid interfaces and the salt concentration enrichment caused by the double layer interaction. The transport behavior is modeled numerically by solving the governing equations using the lattice Poisson--Boltzmann method. The framework is validated by good agreements with the experimental data for all range of ionic concentrations. The modeling results suggest that when the double layers interact, the bulk salt concentration enrichment results in the saturation of conductances for low ionic concentrations. Both the streaming conductance and the electrical conductance are enhanced by the double layer interaction, and such enhancements diminish when the channel size is larger than 10 times of the Debye length. The streaming conductance increases with pH almost linearly when pH {$<$} 8, while the electrical conductance increases with pH exponentially.},

  abstract = {High-quality reservoirs in the third member of Lower Triassic Feixianguan Formation in the Jiannan area are exclusively restricted to dolostone, which makes it essential to understand origin of porosity in dolostone. However, the studies on the porosity origin of the dolostone in the Jiannan area are rare, and its origin is still controversial. In the paper, the formation mechanisms of porosity in replacement dolostones ever proposed worldwide are summarized, and they can be divided into two main categories based on the formation time of porosity relative to the dolomitization process: syndolomitization and postdolomitization origin. Studies on well cores that have been dolomitized to varying degrees indicate that the porosity in dolostones in the Jiannan area is a syndolomitization origin which is intimately associated with the dolomitization process, depending mainly on the degrees of dolomitization. Four stages of porosity evolution, each with distinctive petrographic and petrophysical properties, were distinguished. In initial stage of dolomitization (stage I), dolomite was formed mainly by volume for volume replacement with porosity constant or slight decrease due to external carbonate source added. In the next stages of progressive dolomitization (stage II), only minor intercrystalline pores were developed and the porosity slightly increased. In more advanced stage (stage III), abundant intercrystalline, as well as some vuggy pores, were formed by selectively dissolution of residual microcrystalline calcites and micritized grains, and the porosity remarkably increased with increasing dolomite content. In the most advanced stage (stage IV), dolomite cements were precipitated in pre-exiting pores in dolostone, resulting in varying decrease in porosity and permeability. Carbonates that must proceed at least in the stage III have the high porosity, while the dolostones in the stage II-2 that display similar rock frameworks only have a minor increase in porosity.},

The main goals were to verify the position and the integrity of the underground storage tanks (UST), and to determine the effectiveness of remediation to ensure no contaminants remained at the site. In general, the GPR survey was effective at locating shallowly buried objects. However, due to the highly conductive nature of the heavy-metal laden sludge, the GPR signals were attenuated severely. Thus, the first attempt to use GPR in the pre-remediation investigation did not achieve the desired results and other methods were deployed. The existence of the UST and the sludge within were confirmed by ERT and the UST shape was mapped by FDEM. The principal remediation scheme was soil replacement by replacing the contaminated soil with clean silt. Based on the distinctive property differences of the contaminated soil and the clean silt, the completion of the remediation was confirmed by the differences between pre-remediation and post-remediation in GPR, ERT and FDEM results.},

These nanowires were previously thought to be type IV pili composed of PilA protein. Here, we report a 3.7 A{\r{}} resolution cryoelectron microscopy structure, which surprisingly reveals that, rather than PilA, G. sulfurreducens nanowires are assembled by micrometer-long polymerization of the hexaheme cytochrome OmcS, with hemes packed within \$3.5--6 A{\r{}} of each other. The inter-subunit interfaces show unique structural elements such as inter-subunit parallel-stacked hemes and axial coordination of heme by histidines from neighboring subunits. Wild-type OmcS filaments show 100-fold greater conductivity than other filaments from a DomcS strain, highlighting the importance of OmcS to conductivity in these nanowires. This structure explains the remarkable capacity of soil bacteria to transport electrons to remote electron acceptors for respiration and energy sharing.},

Externally supplementation of electron donors or acceptors is often difficult to control and/or involves chemical additions with limited lifespan, residue formation or other adverse side effects. Microbial electrochemistry has evolved very fast in the past years -- this field relates to the study of electrochemical interactions between microorganisms and solid-state electron donors or acceptors. Current can be supplied in such so-called bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) at low voltage to provide or extract electrons in a very precise manner. A plethora of metabolisms can be linked to electrical current now, from metals reductions to denitrification and dechlorination. In this perspective, we provide an overview of the emerging applications of BES and derived technologies towards the bioremediation field and outline how this approach can be game changing.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY             Induced polarization (IP) has been widely used to non-invasively characterize electrical conduction and polarization in the subsurface resulting from an applied electric field. Earth materials exhibit a lossy capacitance defined by a negative intrinsic phase in frequency-domain IP (FDIP) or a positive intrinsic chargeability in time-domain IP (TDIP). However, error-free positive apparent phase or negative apparent chargeability (i.e. negative IP effects) can occur in IP measurements over heterogeneous media. While negative IP effects in TDIP data sets have been discussed, no studies have addressed this topic in detail for FDIP measurements. We describe theory and numerical modelling to explain the origin of negative IP effects in FDIP measurements. A positive apparent phase may occur when a relatively high polarizability feature falls into negative sensitivity zones of complex resistivity measurements. The polarity of the apparent phase is determined by the distribution of subsurface intrinsic phase and resistivity, with the resistivity impacting the apparent phase polarity via its control on the sensitivity distribution. A physical explanation for the occurrence of positive apparent phase data is provided by an electric circuit model representing a four-electrode measurement. We also show that the apparent phase polarity will be frequency dependent when resistivity changes significantly with frequency (i.e. in the presence of significant IP effects). Consequently, negative IP effects manifest themselves in the shape of apparent phase spectra recorded with multifrequency (spectral IP) data sets. Our results imply that positive apparent phase measurements should be anticipated and should be retained during inversion and interpretation of single frequency and spectral IP data sets.},

  abstract = {Root water uptake by plants is a vital process that influences terrestrial energy, water, and carbon exchanges. At the soil, vegetation, and atmosphere interfaces, root water uptake and solar radiation predominantly regulate the dynamics and health of vegetation growth, which can be remotely monitored by satellites, using the soil--plant relationship proxy -- solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence. However, most current canopy photosynthesis and fluorescence models do not account for root water uptake, which compromises their applications under water-stressed conditions. To address this limitation, this study integrated photosynthesis, fluorescence emission, and transfer of energy, mass, and momentum in the soil--plant--atmosphere continuum system, via a simplified 1D root growth model and a resistance scheme linking soil, roots, leaves, and the atmosphere. The coupled model was evaluated with field measurements of maize and grass canopies. The results indicated that the simulation of land surface fluxes was significantly improved by the coupled model, especially when the canopy experienced moderate water stress. This finding highlights the importance of enhanced soil heat and moisture transfer, as well as dynamic root growth, on simulating ecosystem functioning.},

In this article, the design of a 3-D Overhauser magnetic gradiometer is presented. Taking the sensor array interferences and working efficiency into account, a time slice overlapping based operating time sequence is devised. A precision narrowband tuning capacitance network based on a cascaded subdivision strategy is constructed to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of free induction decay (FID) signals. Additionally, a frequency measuring approach combining multiphase clock and multichannel is developed to suppress counting errors and improve the frequency measuring accuracy of FID signals. The 3-D Overhauser magnetic gradiometer's effectiveness was validated through extensive laboratory and field experiments. The laboratory test results show that the magnetic measuring performance of each sensor from the Overhauser magnetic sensor array is consistent. The proposed 3-D Overhauser magnetic gradiometer is able to measure magnetic fields from 20 to 100 {\textmu}T with an indicating error of less than 0.1 nT. The field exploration demonstrates the applicability of the gradiometer for shallow subsurface UXO detection within the urban complex electromagnetic surroundings. Overall, this study can provide support for the accurate detection and localization of shallow subsurface UXO under strong interference surroundings.},

When soils dry below critical soil moisture thresholds, ecosystems transition from energy to water limitation as stomata close to alleviate water stress               3,4               . However, the mechanisms behind these thresholds remain poorly defined at the ecosystem scale. Here, by analysing observations of critical soil moisture thresholds globally, we show the prominent role of soil texture in modulating the onset of ecosystem water limitation through the soil hydraulic conductivity curve, whose steepness increases with sand fraction. This clarifies how ecosystem sensitivity to VPD versus soil moisture is shaped by soil texture, with ecosystems in sandy soils being relatively more sensitive to soil drying, whereas ecosystems in clayey soils are relatively more sensitive to VPD. For the same reason, plants in sandy soils have limited potential to adjust to water limitations, which has an impact on how climate change affects terrestrial ecosystems. In summary, although vegetation--atmosphere exchanges are driven by atmospheric conditions and mediated by plant adjustments, their fate is ultimately dependent on the soil.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Water infiltration and recharge processes in karst systems are complex and difficult to measure with conventional hydrological methods. In particular, temporarily saturated groundwater reservoirs hosted in the vadose zone can play a~buffering role in water infiltration. This results from the pronounced porosity and permeability contrasts created by local karstification processes of carbonate rocks. Analyses of time-lapse 2-D geoelectrical imaging over a~period of 3~years at the Rochefort Cave Laboratory (RCL) site in south Belgium highlight variable hydrodynamics in a~karst vadose zone. This represents the first long-term and permanently installed electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) monitoring in a~karst landscape. The collected data were compared to conventional hydrological measurements (drip discharge monitoring, soil moisture and water conductivity data sets) and a~detailed structural analysis of the local geological structures providing a~thorough understanding of the groundwater infiltration. Seasonal changes affect all the imaged areas leading to increases in resistivity in spring and summer attributed to enhanced evapotranspiration, whereas winter is characterised by a~general decrease in resistivity associated with a~groundwater recharge of the vadose zone. Three types of hydrological dynamics, corresponding to areas with distinct lithological and structural features, could be identified via changes in resistivity: (D1)~upper conductive layers, associated with clay-rich soil and epikarst, showing the highest variability related to weather conditions; (D2)~deeper and more resistive limestone areas, characterised by variable degrees of porosity and clay contents, hence showing more diffuse seasonal variations; and (D3)~a~conductive fractured zone associated with damped seasonal dynamics, while showing a~great variability similar to that of the upper layers in response to rainfall events. This study provides detailed images of the sources of drip discharge spots traditionally monitored in caves and aims to support modelling approaches of karst hydrological processes.},

Landslide impact on communities can be reduced using efficient early warning systems to plan mitigation measures and protect elements at risk. This manuscript presents an innovative geophysical approach to monitoring landslide dynamics, which combines electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and low-frequency distributed acoustic sensing (DAS), and was deployed on a slope representative of many landslides in clay rich lowland slopes. ERT is used to create detailed, dynamic moisture maps that highlight zones of moisture accumulation leading to slope instability. The link between ERT derived soil moisture and the subsequent initiation of slope deformation is confirmed by low-frequency DAS measurements, which were collocated with the ERT measurements and provide changes in strain at unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution. Auxiliary hydrological and slope displacement data support the geophysical interpretation. By revealing critical zones prone to failure, this combined ERT and DAS monitoring approach sheds new light on landslide mechanisms. This study demonstrates the advantage of including subsurface geophysical monitoring techniques to improve landslide early warning approaches, and highlights the importance of relying on observations from different sources to build effective landslide risk management strategies.},

The proposed transform smoothly modifies the gradient of the transformation so that in the region near zero it remains finite. A single constant is provided to tune this behavior, so as to adjust the meaning of ''region near zero''. This modified logarithmic transformation can be both one-sided or symmetric, and thus can transform negative data to scaled negative data. It can be applied to both the X and Y data, when it becomes a bi-symmetric log transform.},

Results indicate that mesoscale advective influences are strongly developed. Over a lO-km coastal zone, Bowen ratios (\{3) decrease exponentially inland, 2.7 fold during onshore winds and 1.8 fold during offshore winds. This decrease is due both to boundary layer adjustments to a new surface under onshore winds and to horizontal and vertical convergence and divergence in the atmosphere under all wind conditions. Horizontal convergence and divergence is most evident near the coast. The former is most common during periods of low wind speed and the latter during stronger winds. The strongest mesoscale advective impacts on the turbulent fluxes occur within 10 km of the coast. Although in hummocky tundra, the surface may appear to be saturated because of standing water, the drier hummocks serve to reduce the average surface vapor pressure substantially below saturation and thus to reduce the latent heat flux.\vphantom\}},

  abstract = {Spectral induced polarization (SIP) data are commonly analysed using phenomenological models. Among these models the Cole--Cole (CC) model is the most popular choice to describe the strength and frequency dependence of distinct polarization peaks in the data. More flexibility regarding the shape of the spectrum is provided by decomposition schemes. Here the spectral response is decomposed into individual responses of a chosen elementary relaxation model, mathematically acting as kernel in the involved integral, based on a broad range of relaxation times. A frequently used kernel function is the Debye model, but also the CC model with some other a priorly specified frequency dispersion (e.g. Warburg model) has been proposed as kernel in the decomposition. The different decomposition approaches in use, also including conductivity and resistivity formulations, pose the question to which degree the integral spectral parameters typically derived from the obtained relaxation time distribution are biased by the approach itself. Based on synthetic SIP data sampled from an ideal CC response, we here investigate how the two most important integral output parameters deviate from the corresponding CC input parameters. We find that the total chargeability may be underestimated by up to 80 per cent and the mean relaxation time may be off by up to three orders of magnitude relative to the original values, depending on the frequency dispersion of the analysed spectrum and the proximity of its peak to the frequency range limits considered in the decomposition. We conclude that a quantitative comparison of SIP parameters across different studies, or the adoption of parameter relationships from other studies, for example when transferring laboratory results to the field, is only possible on the basis of a consistent spectral analysis procedure. This is particularly important when comparing effective CC parameters with spectral parameters derived from decomposition results.},

The Debye decomposition (DD) approach is now increasingly being used to analyse SIP signatures in terms of relaxation time distributions due to its flexibility regarding the shape of the spectra. Imaging and time-lapse (monitoring) SIP measurements, capturing SIP variations in space and time, respectively, are now more and more conducted and lead to a drastic increase in the number of spectra considered, which prompts the need for robust and reliable DD tools to extract quantitative parameters from such data. We here present an implementation of the DD method for the analysis of a series of SIP data sets which are expected to only smoothly change in terms of spectral behaviour, such as encountered in many time-lapse applications where measurement geometry does not change. The routine is based on a non-linear least-squares inversion scheme with smoothness constraints on the spectral variation and in addition from one spectrum of the series to the next to deal with the inherent ill-posedness and non-uniqueness of the problem. By means of synthetic examples with typical SIP characteristics we elucidate the influence of the number and range of considered relaxation times on the inversion results.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} A better understanding of root--soil interactions and associated processes is essential in achieving progress in crop breeding and management, prompting the need for high-resolution and non-destructive characterization methods. To date, such methods are still lacking or restricted by technical constraints, in particular the charactization and monitoring of root growth and function in the field. A promising technique in this respect is electrical impedance tomography (EIT), which utilizes low-frequency (\&amp;lt;\,1kHz)- electrical conduction- and polarization properties in an imaging framework. It is well established that cells and cell clusters exhibit an electrical polarization response in alternating electric-current fields due to electrical double layers which form at cell membranes. This double layer is directly related to the electrical surface properties of the membrane, which in turn are influenced by nutrient dynamics (fluxes and concentrations on both sides of the membranes). Therefore, it can be assumed that the electrical polarization properties of roots are inherently related to ion uptake and translocation processes in the root systems. We hereby propose broadband (mHz to hundreds of Hz) multi-frequency EIT as a non-invasive methodological approach for the monitoring and physiological, i.e., functional, characterization of crop root systems. The approach combines the spatial-resolution capability of an imaging method with the diagnostic potential of electrical-impedance spectroscopy. The capability of multi-frequency EIT to characterize and monitor crop root systems was investigated in a rhizotron laboratory experiment, in which the root system of oilseed plants was monitored in a water--filled rhizotron, that is, in a nutrient-deprived environment. We found a low-frequency polarization response of the root system, which enabled the successful delineation of its spatial extension. The magnitude of the overall polarization response decreased along with the physiological decay of the root system due to the stress situation. Spectral polarization parameters, as derived from a pixel-based Debye decomposition analysis of the multi-frequency imaging results, reveal systematic changes in the spatial and spectral electrical response of the root system. In particular, quantified mean relaxation times (of the order of 10ms) indicate changes in the length scales on which the polarization processes took place in the root system, as a response to the prolonged induced stress situation. Our results demonstrate that broadband EIT is a capable, non-invasive method to image root system extension as well as to monitor changes associated with the root physiological processes. Given its applicability on both laboratory and field scales, our results suggest an enormous potential of the method for the structural and functional imaging of root systems for various applications. This particularly holds for the field scale, where corresponding methods are highly desired but to date are lacking.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

However, few instructors outside of the field are privy to this research. In this tutorial review, we focus on six specific cognitive strategies that have received robust support from decades of research: spaced practice, interleaving, retrieval practice, elaboration, concrete examples, and dual coding. We describe the basic research behind each strategy and relevant applied research, present examples of existing and suggested implementation, and make recommendations for further research that would broaden the reach of these strategies.},

We find that a single linear imaginary conductivity-Spor relation holds across a range of single-frequency IP data sets composed of sandstones and unconsolidated sediments that lack an appreciable metallic mineral content. We also apply a recent approach defined as Debye decomposition ͑DD͒ to determine normalized chargeability ͑mn͒, a global estimate of polarization magnitude from available spectral IP ͑SIP͒ data sets. A strong linear relationship between mn and Spor is also found across multiple data sets. However, SIP model parameters determined for samples containing metallic minerals are approximately two orders of magnitude greater than for the model parameters estimated for the nonmetallic sample database. We propose a concept of ``polarizability of the mineralfluid interface per unit Spor'' to explain this difference, which is supported by the observed dependence of IP parameters on fluid conductivity between sample types. We suggest that this linear IP-Spor relation can be considered the IP equivalent of the classical Archie empirical relation. Whereas the Archie relation describes a power-law relation between electrical conductivity due to electrolytic conduction through the available interconnected pore volume, the IP-Spor relation is an equivalent relation between mineral-fluid interfacial polarization and available pore surface area.},

  abstract = {Petrophysical interpretation of resistivity measurements is often hindered by the dependence of resistivity on the interconnected pore fluids and the interconnected pore surfaces. Induced polarization (IP) measurements yield parameters that are only controlled by the interconnected pore surfaces, thereby offering the opportunity to constrain interpretation of resistivity measurements. Using a database composed of 63 sandstone and unconsolidated sediment samples covering nine independent investigations, we identified a strong linear relationship between the real part of surface conductivity ([Formula: see text]) determined from multisalinity ([Formula: see text]) resistivity measurements and the imaginary conductivity ([Formula: see text]) measured with IP at a frequency of about 1~Hz. We found [Formula: see text] with a coefficient of determination ([Formula: see text]) of 0.911 and a standard deviation of [Formula: see text] of 0.022. We found a similar relation when the normalized chargeability (from Debye decomposition) of the frequency dependence of the IP response is used instead of [Formula: see text]. By estimating the true formation factor ([Formula: see text]) recorded at high salinity, we solved for [Formula: see text] and found that it parallels the salinity dependency of the imaginary conductivity, [Formula: see text], as reported in recent studies. We also found that the value of the [Formula: see text] determined from this experimental study was generally consistent with predictions of the POLARIS model when the mobility of the ions in the Stern layer was assumed to be [Formula: see text] of the mobility of the ions in the diffuse layer (considered equal to the mobility of the ions in the bulk solution). We discovered how the identified relationship can be used to significantly improve (1) the estimation of the true formation factor and (2) the groundwater conductivity, from a single salinity resistivity measurement when an IP measurement is also made. The approach offers an opportunity to improve estimation of porosity, formation factor, and salinity in well logging and hydrogeophysical investigations.},

We present a method for monitoring soil-water redistributions due to water uptake by roots. Our aim is to image and monitor diurnal soil-water redistribution during a small-scale (centimeter-to-decimeter range) indoor experiment and to correlate water content determined by applied geoelectrical time-lapse imaging techniques with values from single-point time domain reflectometry (TDR) measurements. This includes establishing pedophysical relationships within the root zone and deriving the water-content distribution from the electrical-resistivity model. Using DC geoelectrics of high resolution (970 data points for 220 cm2), we monitored significant spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture with time, whereas no irrigation was applied. Thus, we imaged the high heterogeneity of fluid movements within the soil. We found diurnal variations with high spatial variability of soil water content during the morning and afternoon hours. The water content continuously increased from dawn to noon, whereas the increase started in the near-surface zone from 1 cm to 3 cm above the main root zone. Between 8:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m., water content decreases along most of the sections. Water content irregularly decreases and increases during the afternoon. During night time, we observed nearly no changes in soil water content due to the absence of transpiration and subsequently soil-water redistribution. Most of these diurnal variations in soil water content lie within the intensive root zone, as measurements showed on soil samples excavated from these areas after the experiment.},

In carbonate ecosystems, characterized by the presence of subterranean pores and cavities, ventilation of the CO2 accumulated in these cavities and pores can act as an extra source of CO2 exchange between the ecosystem and the atmosphere. In this work we analyse the effect of the subterranean heterogeneity of a carbonate ecosystem on measurements of CO2 fluxes by comparing measurements from two EC systems with distinct footprints. Results showed that both EC systems agreed for measurements of evapotranspiration and of CO2 in periods when respiratory and photosynthetic processes were dominant (biological periods), with a regression slope of 0.99 and 0.97, respectively. However, in periods when the main source of CO2 comes from the ventilation of subterranean pores and cavities (abiotic periods) agreement is not good, with a regression slope of 0.6. Ground-penetrating radar measurements of the sub-surface confirmed the existence of high sub-surface heterogeneity that, combined with different footprints, lead to differences in the measurements of the two EC systems. These results show that measurements of CO2 fluxes with Eddy covariance systems over carbonate ecosystems must be taken carefully, as they may not be representative of the ecosystem under consideration.},

The soil texture varied from loamy sand to clay loam. The bare plots were kept covered between samplings. Moisture losses in the cropped plots were broken down into consumptive use and drainage. The upper limit was calculated by determining the moisture content when drainage had been reduced to 0.001 inch per day, and adding the consumptive use occurring up to that time. The upper limit values did not accord with field capacity as usually defined. No close relationship was found between the upper limits and breaking points, levelling-off points or other characteristics of either the moisture-time curves from the covered plots or those from the cropped plots. Sampling the soil at 1 to 4 days after an irrigation, depending on the soil texture, gave a close approximation to the upper limit.},

  abstract = {Two strategies are presented for obtaining the maximum spatial resolution in electrical resistivity tomography surveys using a limited number of four-electrode measurement configurations. Both methods use a linearized estimate of the model resolution matrix to assess the effects of including a given electrode configuration in the measurement set. The algorithms are described in detail, and their execution times are analysed in terms of the number of cells in the inverse model. One strategy directly compares the model resolution matrices to optimize the spatial resolution. The other uses approximations based on the distribution and linear independence of the Jacobian matrix elements. The first strategy produces results that are nearer to optimal, however the second is several orders of magnitude faster. Significantly however, both offer better optimization performance than a similar, previously published, method. Realistic examples are used to compare the results of each algorithm. Synthetic data are generated for each optimized set of electrodes using simple forward models containing resistive and/or conductive prisms. By inverting the data, it is demonstrated that the linearized model resolution matrix yields a good estimate of the actual resolution obtained in the inverted image. Furthermore, comparison of the inversion results confirms that the spatial distribution of the estimated model resolution is a reliable indicator of tomographic image quality.},

We test four time-lapse inversion methods (independent inversion, temporal smoothness-constrained 4D inversion, spatial smoothness constrained inversion of temporal data differences, and sequential inversion with spatial smoothness constraints on the model and its temporal changes). We focus on the applicability of these methods to automated processing of geoelectrical monitoring data in near real-time. In particular, we examine windowed 4D inversion, the use of short sequences of time-lapse data, without which the 4D method would not be suitable in the near real-time context. We develop measures of internal consistency for the different methods so that the effects of the use of short time windows or the choice of baseline data set can be compared. The resulting inverse models are assessed against qualitative and quantitative ground truth information. Our findings are that 4D inversion of the full data set performed best, and that windowed 4D inversion retained the majority of its benefits while also being applicable to applications requiring near real-time inversion.},

Vectors in 3D space are merely a way of understanding the mathematics of quantum mechanics, which provides the ``true'' description of a single spin-{$\frac{1}{2}$} nucleus. They are a useful aid to understanding, but there is no single ``correct'' vector representation, and the different vector models that are used have advantages and disadvantages. Here, we discuss the 2 standard vector models for a nuclear magnetic resonance spin: the up/down or alignment model and the 2-cone model, and we show how they relate to quantum mechanics. We show why both of these models are limited and discuss a third model, the uniform model, in which individual spins can be in any orientation. We demonstrate how the uniform model presents a clear and logically coherent description for spins: at equilibrium; following a 90{$^\circ$} pulse; and during the subsequent relaxation back to equilibrium. The uniform model is fully consistent with quantum mechanics and leads to an understanding of coherence and relaxation that cannot be obtained from the other 2 models. We suggest that the uniform model is more helpful than the other 2 for most purposes.},

  abstract = {Understanding future land-use related water demand is important for planners and resource managers in identifying potential shortages and crafting mitigation strategies. This is especially the case for regions dependent on limited local groundwater supplies. For the groundwater dependent Central Coast of California, we developed two scenarios of future land use and water demand based on sampling from a historical land change record: a business-as-usual scenario (BAU; 1992--2016) and a recent-modern scenario (RM; 2002--2016). We modeled the scenarios in the stochastic, empirically based, spatially explicit LUCAS state-and-transition simulation model at a high resolution (270-m) for the years 2001--2100 across 10 Monte Carlo simulations, applying current land zoning restrictions. Under the BAU scenario, regional water demand increased by an estimated {\textasciitilde}222.7 Mm3 by 2100, driven by the continuation of perennial cropland expansion as well as higher than modern urbanization rates. Since 2000, mandates have been in place restricting new development unless adequate water resources could be identified. Despite these restrictions, water demand dramatically increased in the RM scenario by 310.6 Mm3 by century's end, driven by the projected continuation of dramatic orchard and vineyard expansion trends. Overall, increased perennial cropland leads to a near doubling to tripling perennial water demand by 2100. Our scenario projections can provide water managers and policy makers with information on diverging land use and water use futures based on observed land change and water use trends, helping to better inform land and resource management decisions.},

The simulation represents a case where the fluid is introduced into a 25 m aquifer at a depth of 45 m. The contaminant fluid is assumed to be electrically more conductive than the in-situ ground water. Resistivity measurements were sUnulated using a finite difference algorithm to calculate potentials for an arbitrary three-dimensional resistivity distribution with surface and downhole current and potential electrodes. A downhole/surface array was considered where current was injected at the aquifer depth and voltage measurements were made on the surface. We considered cases where current was injected at a point within the contaminant plume as well as outside of the plume (offset case). We considered three contaminant distributions: case 1, the contaminant plume forms a uniform cylinder centered around the injection well; case 2, the plume forms a nonuniform cylinder around the well where contaminant concentration decreases away from the well; case 3, the aquifer has a variable vertical permeability. Results indicate that the anomaly is much greater using the downhole electrode than for surface arrays and that the data may be used to roughly characterize the contaminant mass and its boundaries. Several cases involving different contaminant boundaries were studied and show that the downhole/surface measurements are not very sensitive to differences in the boundary geometry although a rough determina t ion of the boundary pos it ion is pos sible. For the case where the downhole current electrode is located ouside of or at the edge of the contaminant, the anomaly size is smaller but the shape allows for good discrimination of the near-side boundary.},

  abstract = {Abstract               The abnormal conductivity found in shaly reservoir rocks containing anelectrolyte is shown to be a consequence of the electrical double layer in thesolution adjacent to charged clay surfaces. This increased conductivity resultsfrom a higher concentration of ions in the double layer than in the solution inequilibrium with the double layer. It is shown that the magnitude of theincreased conductivity of a shaly reservoir material is influenced by theconcentration and type of ions in the equilibrium solution as well as by thecolloidal nature of the rock.                                Introduction                 An important factor in the quantitative interpretation of the electric logis the resistivity factor of reservoir rock. The resistivity factor is definedas the resistivity of the rock when completely saturated with an electrolytedivided by the resistivity of the electrolyte itself. In the normal case, theresistivity factor for a particular rock sample is independent of theresistivity of the electrolyte and reflects the pore geometry of the rock.                 In 1949, Patnode and Wyllie showed that in some cases the resistivity factoris not constant, but instead varies with the resistivity of the electrolyticsolution. It was shown that clean sands behave normally - i.e., that theresistivity factor does not vary with resistivity of the electrolyte - but thatsands con taining shale and clay may exhibit abnormally low resistivity factors when thesolution used to saturate them is of fairly high resistivity. At lowresistivities of the electrolyte, the resistivity factor for a shaly sandappeared to approach a normal behavior. It is evident that the resistivityfactor of a shaly sand is dependent upon factors other than pore geometry whenthe solution used to saturate it is of high resistivity.                 Patnode and Wyllie, and later de Witte, assumed that the conductivity of ashaly sand saturated with an electrolyte could be represented as the sum of twoquantities. One of these was assumed, in effect, to be the conductivity whichwould be expected if the sample were a clean sand, and the other was assumed tobe a conductivity inherent in the sample itself. The latter was supposed to beconstant for a given rock sample regardless of the solution used to saturateit. The source of this added conductivity was ascribed to "conductivesolids."                 In actual practice, the effect of the abnormal behavior of shaly sands is ofminor importance except when the resistivity of a formation such as a sand ishigh. Thus the effect is more important when the sand is saturated with adilute brine than when it contains a more concentrated electrolyte. The effectis also more important when the sample contains oil or gas than when itcontains only saline water.                 T.P. 3565},

  abstract = {A disseminated sulfide ore is idealized by a system of electronically conducting metallic spheres randomly dispersed in an electrolytically conducting host medium. When an external electric field is applied, the transport of cations and anions in the interphase region near the metal-electrolyte interface will involve both drift and diffusion flux densities. The flow of ions to or from the metal-electrolyte interface causes an excess or deficit of inactive ions to accumulate there, since the metal is neither a source nor sink for these ions. These inactive ions are loosely held to the metallic particles by image forces, and concentration gradients build up which oppose the migration of these ions due to electric fields. In addition to the inactive anions and cations, a minor concentration of active cations is assumed to exist in the electrolytic medium, and the electric fields at the electrolyte-metal interface cause these to engage in electrochemical reactions making possible charge transfer across the interface. Under these conditions, coupled partial differential equations describing the temporal and spatial variations in the concentrations of active and inactive ions can be derived by considering the net flux of cations and anions into a small test volume of the host medium. The variations are expressed as perturbations on the background concentrations and are found when the partial differential equations are solved using the Laplace transformation and separation of variables in spherical coordinates. The perturbation concentrations are Gouy-Chapman types of diffuse distributions localized near the metal-electrolyte interface with thickness on the order of the Debye screening length. The cloud of loosely held ions surrounding each metallic particle and the diffusion-controlled charge transfer reaction at the interface are responsible for inducing a time- or frequency-dependent electric dipole moment on each particle. With the assumption that no mutual interactions exist between these dipoles, the effective conductivity (in frequency domain) of an assemblage of metallic spheres residing in an electrolytic host medium can be found by using Maxwell's formula. The resulting frequency dispersion in the effective conductivity is the basis of the induced-polarization (IP) effect. Conductivity and resistivity spectra calculated from this electrochemical model are compared to laboratory measurements on synthetic metalliferous ores, and good fits with the experimental data are obtained by using physically reasonable values for the various parameters in the model.},

In this study, we conducted laboratory column experiments to explore the potential of the complex resistivity method for monitoring the freeze--thaw transitions of the arctic permafrost soils. Samples for the experiment were collected from the upper active layer of Gelisol soils at the Barrow Environmental Observatory (BEO) in Barrow, Alaska. Freeze--thaw transitions were induced through exposing the soil column to controlled temperature environments at 4 and -20{$^\circ$}C. Complex resistivity and temperature measurements were collected regularly during the freeze--thaw transitions using electrodes and temperature sensors installed along the column. During the experiments, over two orders of magnitude of resistivity variations were observed when the temperature was increased or decreased between -20 and 0{$^\circ$}C. Smaller resistivity variations were also observed during the isothermal thawing or freezing processes that occurred near 0{$^\circ$}C. Single frequency electrical phase response and imaginary conductivity at 1 Hz were found to be exclusively related to the unfrozen water in the soil matrix, suggesting that these geophysical attributes can be used as a proxy for the monitoring of the onset and progression of the freeze--thaw transitions. Spectral electrical responses and fitted Cole--Cole parameters contained additional information about the freeze--thaw transition affected by the soil grain size distribution. Specifically, a shift of the observed spectral response to lower frequency was observed during the isothermal thawing process, which we interpret to be due to sequential thawing, first from fine particles and then to coarse particles within the soil matrix. Our study demonstrates the potential of the complex resistivity method for remote monitoring of freeze--thaw transitions in arctic soils. Although conducted at the laboratory scale, this study provides the foundation for exploring the potential of the complex resistivity signals for monitoring spatiotemporal variations of freeze--thaw transitions over field-relevant scales.},

Due to its large internal electronic conductivity and ability to polarize under external potential field, significant enhancement of its spectral induced polarization (SIP) responses is observed when graphite is included in sand mixtures. While a small amount of graphite inclusion significantly increases the SIP response of its mixtures with sand, further concentration increase does not necessarily lead to a proportional increase of the SIP response. This is shown to be related to the formation of graphite aggregates at higher concentrations. Changes of fluid salinity have a significant effect on graphite's SIP behaviour. This includes a positive impact on normalized chargeability and imaginary conductivity, but a negative impact on chargeability and relaxation time constant. The effect of pH on the SIP response of graphite is small but shows consistent trend, where pH increase leads to a decrease of both the chargeability and relaxation time constant. The underlying cause of this effect is not clear.},

  abstract = {During wetting-drying cycles, divergence is often found between the immediately improved soil water conditions after re-watering and the recovery of plant water status from stress, which ensues only gradually. Such an apparent hysteresis effect of water stress (HEWS) is usually neglected in simulating root-water-uptake (RWU) by empirical models. To consider HEWS in the empirical macroscopic RWU model of Feddes, a water stress recovery coefficient ({$\delta$}) was introduced based on two lysimetric experiments under greenhouse and field conditions for winter wheat. The integrated effects of historical water stress events were investigated by assuming that the normalized influence weight of each past stress event declines with the increase of time interval before simulation as an exponential function of attenuation rate. Although {$\delta$} could be described by an exponential function of an integrative index representing the general historical stress extent (R2 = 0.65, P {$<$} 0.001), with an attenuation rate smaller than 0.13, it is challenging to establish such a function practically. An attenuation rate close to zero means HEWS is mainly dominated by the water stress on the previous day, validated by a significant relationship between the relative transpiration or stomatal conductance on the day after irrigation and the water stress extent on the day before irrigation. Therefore, a simplification, substituting the integrative index in the exponential function with the stress extent on the previous day, was proposed for estimating {$\delta$}. Compared to the traditional RWU model, the revised model considering HEWS was more successful in simulating relative transpiration and soil water dynamics. Root mean square error of relative transpiration was reduced by 65.9 \% and of soil water by 30 \% in the greenhouse experiment and by 7.4 \% and 12.5 \%, respectively, in the field experiment.},

However, vegetation strongly affects with CRNS soil moisture measurements. Variations in vegetation over time change how the CRNS is affected, which is more challenging than a stable vegetation cover, particularly during CRNS roving, where one crosses many vegetation covers. To correct vegetation, we hypothesized that Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) can represent vegetation hydrogen pools. From 2020 to 2023, at the 74 plots with varying vegetation cover near the Qilian Mountains, the experiments for soil moisture measurements were conducted in shrubs, forests, deserts, farmlands, and grasslands using a Cosmic-ray Neutron Rover. The measured neutron intensity clearly varied across different landscapes, and the calibrated parameter N0 differed among 74 plots. The variations in vegetation cover resulted in low measurement accuracy for CRNS. All three NDVI vegetation correction methods (NDVI-{\texttheta}NDVI method, NDVI-NDVIave method, and NDVI-N0 method) offered by the study could improve accuracy of soil moisture measurements. In the optimal NDVI-N0 method, the relationship between NDVI and N0 was established using a power function y = 373.9 (x + 0.015) 0.136 (R2 = 0.77), which had the capability to decrease the root mean square error between oven-dried and measured soil moisture from 0.093 to 0.032 g g 1 in our study area. Employing NDVI instead of biomass for CRNS vegetation correction can substantially reduce workload and effectively enhance CRNS soil moisture measurements, showing the potential for upscaling soil moisture.},

  abstract = {Robust calibration of an agricultural-hydrological model is critical for simulating crop yield and water quality and making reasonable agricultural management. However, calibration of the agriculturalhydrological system models is challenging because of model complexity, the existence of strong parameter correlation, and significant computational requirements. Therefore, only a limited number of simulations can be allowed in any attempt to find a near-optimal solution within an affordable time, which greatly restricts the successful application of the model. The goal of this study is to locate the optimal solution of the Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM2) given a limited simulation time, so as to improve the model simulation and help make rational and effective agricultural-hydrological decisions. To this end, we propose a computationally efficient global optimization procedure using sparse-grid based surrogates. We first used advanced sparse grid (SG) interpolation to construct a surrogate system of the actual RZWQM2, and then we calibrate the surrogate model using the global optimization algorithm, Quantum-behaved Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO). As the surrogate model is a polynomial with fast evaluation, it can be efficiently evaluated with a sufficiently large number of times during the optimization, which facilitates the global search. We calibrate seven model parameters against five years of yield, drain flow, and NO3-N loss data from a subsurface-drained corn-soybean field in Iowa. Results indicate that an accurate surrogate model can be created for the RZWQM2 with a relatively small number of SG points (i.e., RZWQM2 runs). Compared to the conventional QPSO algorithm, our surrogatebased optimization method can achieve a smaller objective function value and better calibration performance using a fewer number of expensive RZWQM2 executions, which greatly improves computational efficiency.},

Firstly, triaxial compression tests on sand samples under undrained conditions were performed to investigate the influences of freezing--thawing cycles, which shows that the freezing--thawing actions can weaken their strength and stiffness, and with the increasing freezing--thawing cycles, both the deviatoric stress and pore water pressure decrease gradually. Then, the double hardening constitutive model was revised to model the influences of freezing--thawing cycles in consideration of the influences of freezing--thawing actions, and the model was also validated by the test results. Finally, the proposed constitutive model was incorporated into a finite element code to numerically simulate the distribution of displacement and pore water pressure of sand slope subjected to freezing--thawing cycles, which shows that the freezing--thawing actions accelerate the dissipation of the pore water pressure and enlarge the displacement of the slope. The study here can provide a help in designing and construction of civil engineering in cold regions.},

  abstract = {This study evaluates seven evapotranspiration models and their performance in water balance studies by using lysimeter measurement data at the Mo{\textasciidieresis}nchengladbach hydrological and meteorological station in Germany. Of the seven evapotranspiration models evaluated, three models calculate actual evapotranspiration directly using the complementary relationship approach, i.e. the CRAE model of Morton, the advection--aridity (AA) model of Brutsaert and Stricker, and the GG model of Granger and Gray, and four models calculate first potential evapotranspiration and then actual evapotranspiration by considering the soil moisture condition. Two of the four potential evapotranspiration models belong to the temperature-based category, i.e. the Thornthwaite model and the Hargreaves model, and the other two belong to the radiation-based category, i.e. the Makkink model and the Priestley--Taylor model. The evapotranspiration calculated by the above seven models, together with precipitation, is used in the water balance model to calculate other water balance components. The results show that, for the calculation of actual evapotranspiration, the GG model and the Makkink model performed better than the other models; for the calculation of groundwater recharge using the water balance approach, the GG model and the AA models performed better; for the simulation of soil moisture content using the water balance approach, four models (GG, Thornthwaite, Makkink and Priestley--Taylor) out of the seven give equally good results. It can be concluded that the lysimeter-measured water balance components, i.e. actual evapotranspiration, groundwater recharge, soil moisture, etc., can be predicted by the GG model and the Makkink model with good accuracy.

Time domain reflectometry sensors have been combined with heat pulse sensors to produce thermo-TDR sensors. Thermo-TDR sensors are restricted to having relatively short needles to accurately measure soil thermal properties. Short needle lengths, however, can limit the accuracy of the TDR measurement of soil water content. Frequency domain reflectometry (FDR) sensors are an alternative to TDR sensors that can provide an inexpensive measurement of soil water content. The objective of this study was to determine whether short FDR sensors can accurately measure soil water content. We designed and constructed a short FDR sensor. For four soil types across a range of water contents, temperatures, and salt contents, we measured soil dielectric spectra with the short FDR sensor. A vector network analyzer was used to obtain soil dielectric spectra in the 1-MHz to 3-GHz frequency range. The ideal frequency of a short FDR sensor is the frequency at which the permittivity is not altered by changing temperature or salt content. The 47- to 200-MHz range was an ideal frequency range for measuring soil water content, and 70 MHz was the frequency least influenced by temperature and salt content. The short FDR sensor provided quick, continuous, stable, and cheap measurements of soil water content. Because of the promising performance of the short thermo-FDR sensor in laboratory studies, sensors should be evaluated in future field studies.},

Using cryo-electron microscopy with multimodal functional imaging and a suite of electrical, biochemical, and physiological studies, we find that rather than pili, nanowires are composed of cytochromes OmcS and OmcZ that transport electrons via seamless stacking of hemes over micrometers. We discuss the physiological need for two different nanowires and their potential applications for sensing, synthesis, and energy production.},

The vertical distribution of SOC differed in various climatic zones and biomes; SOC distributed deeper in arid climate and water-limited biomes than in humid climate. An analysis of general linear model suggested that climate, vegetation, and soil texture significantly influenced spatial pattern of SOC, explaining 78.2\% of the total variance, and that climate and vegetation interpreted 78.9\% of the total variance in the vertical SOC distribution.},

This study introduces the mechanical structure and working principle of a new LWD caliper based on ultrasonic distance measurement (UDM). The detection range is a major performance index of a UDM system. This index is determined by the blind zone length and remote reflecting interface detection capability of the system. To reduce the blind zone length and detect near the reflecting interface, a full bridge acoustic emission technique based on bootstrap gate driver (BGD) and metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) is designed by analyzing the working principle and impedance characteristics of a given piezoelectric transducer. To detect the remote reflecting interface and reduce the dynamic range of the received echo signals, the relationships between the echo amplitude and propagation distance of ultrasonic waves are determined. A signal compensation technique based on time-varying amplification theory, which can automatically change the gain according to the echo arrival time is designed. Lastly, the aforementioned techniques and corresponding circuits are experimentally verified. Results show that the blind zone length in the UDM system of the LWD caliper is significantly reduced and the capability to detect the remote reflecting interface is considerably improved.},

Although studied for decades, critical gaps exist in the study of plant roots, the rhizosphere microbiome and the soil system surrounding roots, partly due to the challenges associated with measuring and parsing these spatiotemporal interactions in complex heterogeneous systems such as soil. To overcome the challenges associated with               in situ               study of rhizosphere interactions, specialized plant growth chamber systems have been developed that mimic the natural growth environment. This review discusses the currently available lab-based systems ranging from widely known rhizotrons to other emerging devices designed to allow continuous monitoring and non-destructive sampling of the rhizosphere ecosystems in real-time throughout the developmental stages of a plant. We categorize them based on the major rhizosphere processes it addresses and identify their unique challenges as well as advantages. We find that while some design elements are shared among different systems (e.g., size exclusion membranes), most of the systems are bespoke and speaks to the intricacies and specialization involved in unraveling the details of rhizosphere processes. We also discuss what we describe as the next generation of growth chamber employing the latest technology as well as the current barriers they face. We conclude with a perspective on the current knowledge gaps in the rhizosphere which can be filled by innovative chamber designs.},

Identifying the characteristics of groundwater is an important basis to formulate a management plan for water resources and develop the technology of controlling desertification in arid areas scientifically. It is also important to the environmental protection in China. Ground penetrating radar (GPR) signals produce a special response to the changes in water content during propagation, thus it is essential to study the propagation of electromagnetic pulse in aeolian sand with different water content. The GPR tests of aeolian sand samples with different water content were conducted by a GPR system, dielectric constant meter, and conductivity meter. The temporal and frequency spectral characteristics of electromagnetic signals measured from aeolian sand samples were analyzed. The results show that the dielectric constant and conductivity of aeolian sand increase nonlinearly as the water content increases, and the attenuation coefficient of electromagnetic pulses increases parabolically. Meanwhile, the temporal waveform fluctuates significantly at the boundary of different media, and its two-way travel time increases nonlinearly as the water content increases, the pulse velocity decreases nonlinearly. Furthermore, the peak frequency of the spectrum for a signal propagating through aeolian sand decreases as the water content increases. The peak frequency is concentrated in the 1000 to 1400 MHz range, but the shape and bandwidth of the spectrum are less affected by water content. The above-mentioned correlations can provide a water content estimation of aeolian sand with direct value to the local authorities which are involved in the decision-making process for effective water management in arid and semi-arid area.},

  abstract = {Soil moisture is directly related to the amount of irrigation in agriculture and influences the yield of crops. Accordingly, a soil moisture sensor is an important tool for measuring soil moisture content. In this study, the previous research conducted in recent 2-3 decades on soil moisture sensors was reviewed and the principles of commonly used soil moisture sensor and their various applications were summarized. Furthermore, the advantages, disadvantages, and influencing factors of various measurement methods employed were compared and analyzed. The improvements were presented by several scholars have established the major applications and performance levels of soil moisture sensors, thereby setting the course for future development. These studies indicated that soil moisture sensors in the future should be developed to achieve high-precision, low-cost, non-destructive, automated, and highly integrated systems. Also, it was indicated that future studies should involve the development of specialized sensors for different applications and scenarios. This review research aimed to provide a certain reference for application departments and scientific researchers in the process of selecting soil moisture sensor products and measuring soil moisture.},

Several commercial sensors are available; however, they only provide point-information. To value-add to this soil data, mathematical models can be used in conjunction with proximal sensed data, such as soil apparent electrical conductivity (ECa, mS m-1) or inverted ECa ({$\sigma$}, mS m-1). In this research, we determine if ECa from an electromagnetic (EM) instrument (EM38) at various heights (0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0 m) or {$\sigma$} estimated from ECa can be used to value add to limited {\texttheta} at four depths (i.e., 0.15, 0.45, 0.75 and 1.35 m). Moreover, we compare which mathematical (i.e. multiple linear regression (MLR), random forest (RF), Cubist, support vector machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)) model can best be used to predict {\texttheta} from {$\sigma$}. We also determine the number of calibration sites required along a uniform heavy-clay transect used for furrow irrigated cotton. In terms of a leave-one-out cross validation, the best Lin's concordance between measured and predicted {\texttheta} was achieved using SVM (0.91) when estimates of {$\sigma$} and depth used to model {\texttheta} . We showed that satisfactory results could be achieved using a single calibration site. Considering the results at day 10 when permanent wilting point was evident, irrigation scheduling could be recommended based on the use of the EM38h0 (80 mS m-1) and EM38v0 (100 mS m-1) reaching critical measurements.},

  abstract = {Field-scale induced polarization (IP) data remain underutilized due to the challenges of data acquisition and interpretation of the resulting observations for near surface environmental applications. We use measurements at a test site and the principle of IP reciprocity to demonstrate that the primary factor controlling the quality of IP data acquired using standard resistivity/IP imaging systems is the signal to noise ratio (SNR), i.e., the recorded signal strength. This factor favors the use of nested arrays, where one or two of the potential electrodes fall between the current electrode pair, that guarantee a high primary voltage (Vp) versus DipoleDipole type arrays where voltage differences rapidly decay away from the current injection pair. Comparison of data acquired using stainless steel, Cu-CuSO4 porous pot and graphite electrodes demonstrates that electrode material is a significant second order factor but only for measurements where the SNR is relatively low (for the instrument used in this study when Vp , 30 mV). We also propose a simple framework for interpretation of environmental IP datasets whereby the acquisition of IP data is used to remove the inherent ambiguity in the interpretation of standalone resistivity data such that the subsurface distribution of the surface conductivity and electrolytic conductivity contributions to the total conductivity can be resolved. We demonstrate this approach on a field site within a first order catchment where a high surface area formation likely limits vertical transport and promotes interflow. Sharp contrasts in electrical structure between the two slopes of the catchment are observed.},

Although previous model studies suggest that this integral is consistent with the potential calculated by the 1D version of Poisson's equation in the limit of long diffusion times, it is shown here, with a simple static model, that this may be true in the 3D space only at an infinitely large cross-section of the junction. At finite cross-sections, supposing that a charge separation exists, the potential difference across it is a function of the area of the crosssection and the distance across it, which is at variance with the properties of the integral. It is argued therefore that this integral cannot be interpreted in terms of electrostatics, but represents a quantity, the EMF, which is conceptually different from the potential.},

Every used technique may present some possible errors tied with the utilized specific technique, soil inhomogeneities, or physical phenomena such as latent heat conversion beneath the plates, especially in desiccation cracking soil or vertisol. The installation place may also induce imbalances. Finally, some errors resulting from the physical sensor presence, vegetation presence, or soil inhomogeneities may occur and are not avoidable. For all these reasons it is important to check the validity of the measurements. A quick and easy way is to integrate results over 1 year. By consideration of the inert core internal energy conservation law, it is shown that the corresponding integration should be close to zero after a necessary geothermal heat efflux subtraction. However, below-plate evaporation and vegetation-absorbed water or rainwater infiltration may also contribute to the observed short-scale and/or longscale imbalance generating convective heat fluxes not sensed by the heat flux sensors. Another energy source is usually not included in the SEB equation: rainfall or irrigation. Yet its importance for short- and long-term integration is notable. As an example, the most used sensor, soil heat flux plates (SHFPs), is given.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Soil water content (SWC) sensors are widely used for scientific studies or for the management of agricultural practices. The most common sensing techniques provide an estimate of volumetric soil water content based on sensing of dielectric permittivity. These techniques include frequency domain reflectometry (FDR), time domain reflectometry (TDR), capacitance and even remote-sensing techniques such as ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and microwave-based techniques. Here, we will focus on frequency domain reflectometry (FDR) sensors and more specifically on the questioning of their factory calibration, which does not take into account soil-specific features and therefore possibly leads to inconsistent SWC estimates. We conducted the present study in the southwest of France on two plots that are part of the ICOS ERIC network (Integrated Carbon Observation System, European Research and Infrastructure Consortium), FR-Lam and FR-Aur. We propose a simple protocol for soil-specific calibration, particularly suitable for clayey soil, to improve the accuracy of SWC determination when using commercial FDR sensors. We compared the sensing accuracy after soil-specific calibration versus factory calibration. Our results stress the necessity of performing a thorough soil-specific calibration for very clayey soils. Hence, locally, we found that factory calibration results in a strong overestimation of the actual soil water content. Indeed, we report relative errors as large as +115\,\% with a factory-calibrated sensor based on the real part of dielectric permittivity and up to +\,245\,\% with a factory-calibrated sensor based on the modulus of dielectric permittivity.},

  abstract = {Modeling variably saturated flow in the vadose zone is of vital importance to many scientific fields and engineering applications. Richardson--Richards equation (RRE, which is conventionally known as Richards' equation) is often chosen to physically represent the fluxes in the vadose zone when the accurate characterization of the soil water dynamics is required. Being a highly nonlinear partial differential equation, RRE is often solved numerically. Although there are mature software and codes available for simulating variably saturated flow by solving RRE, the numerical solution of RRE is nevertheless computationally expensive. Moreover, sometimes the robustness and the efficiency of RRE-based models can deteriorate rapidly when certain unfavorable conditions are met. These demerits of RRE hinder its application on large-scale vadose zone hydrology problems and uncertainty quantification, both of which requires many runs of the prediction model. To address these challenges, the accuracy, convergence, and efficiency of the numerical schemes of RRE should be further improved by testing a wide variety of cases covering different initial conditions, boundary conditions, and soil types. We reviewed and highlighted several critical issues related to the numerical modeling of RRE, including spatial and temporal discretization, the different forms of RREs, iterative and noniterative schemes, benchmark solutions, and available software and codes. Based on the review, we summarize the challenges and future work for solving RRE numerically.},

Soil water content was measured nondestructively every 1 to 2 d in fall moldboard (CT), 1-yr no-tillage (SNT), and longer term ({$>$}15 yr) notillage (LNT) plots using permanently placed time domain reflectometry (TDR) transmission line probes. The plots are located near Guelph, ON, Canada on a Typic Hapludalf (loam) soil. Sampling sites were in the corn row, directly between corn rows (interrow), and halfway between the row and interrow(quarter row). Systematic spatial differences in soil water content, within and between tillage treatments, were observed throughout the entire growing season. Large differences between CT and both LNT and SNT early in the season were attributed to increased evaporation in CT caused by spring secondary tillage. The drying rate in the LNT interrow position was much lower than the CT and SNT interrow drying rates. Soil water recharge from rainfall was distributed systematically in space because of canopy interception and subsequent stemflow. Crop residue on the soil surface of the no-till treatments intercepted a significant amount of rainfall and reduced soil water recharge by 14 and 35\% in the SNT and LNT treatments, respectively. The tillage treatments affected the temporal dependence of the spatial variability of soil water and the spatial dependence of the temporal variability.},

However, the availability and the often prohibitive costs of such imagery would suggest an alternative product for this particular application in PA. Specifically, images taken by low altitude remote sensing platforms, or small unmanned aerial systems (UAS), are shown to be a potential alternative given their low cost of operation in environmental monitoring, high spatial and temporal resolution, and their high flexibility in image acquisition programming. Not surprisingly, there have been several recent studies in the application of UAS imagery for PA. The results of these studies would indicate that, to provide a reliable end product to farmers, advances in platform design, production, standardization of image georeferencing and mosaicing, and information extraction workflow are required. Moreover, it is suggested that such endeavors should involve the farmer, particularly in the process of field design, image acquisition, image interpretation and analysis.},

  abstract = {The abundance and growth stages of bacteria in subsurface porous media affect the concentrations and distributions of charged species within the solid-solution interfaces. Therefore, spectral induced polarization (SIP) measurements can be used to monitor changes in bacterial biomass and growth stage. Our goal was to gain a better understanding of the SIP response of bacteria present in a porous material. Bacterial cell surfaces possess an electric double layer and therefore become polarized in an electric field. We performed SIP measurements over the frequency range of 0.1--1~kHz on cell suspensions alone and cell suspensions mixed with sand at four pore water conductivities. We used Zymomonas mobilis at four different cell densities (including the background). The quadrature conductivity spectra exhibited two peaks, one around 0.05--0.10~Hz and the other around 1--10~Hz. Because SIP measurements on bacterial suspensions are typically made at frequencies greater than 1~Hz, these peaks have not been previously reported. In the bacterial suspensions in growth medium, the quadrature conductivity at peak I was linearly proportional to the density of the bacteria. For the case of the suspensions mixed with sands, we observed that peak II presented a smaller increase in the quadrature conductivity with the cell density. A comparison of the experiments with and without sand grains illustrated the effect of the porous medium on the overall quadrature conductivity response (decrease in the amplitude and shift of the peaks to the lower frequencies). Our results indicate that for a given porous medium, time-lapse SIP has potential for monitoring changes in bacterial abundance within porous media.},

  abstract = {Evapotranspiration is a major component of the global water cycle and provides a critical nexus between terrestrial water, carbon and surface energy exchanges. Evapotranspiration is inherently difficult to measure and predict especially at large spatial scales. Remote sensing provides a cost-effective method to estimate evapotranspiration at regional to global scales. In the past three decades a large number of studies on remote sensing based evapotranspiration estimation have emerged. This review summarizes the basic theories underpinning current remote sensing based evapotranspiration estimation methods. It also lays out the development history of these methods and compares their advantages and limitations. Several key directions for further study are identified and discussed, including identification of uncertainty sources in remote sensing evapotranspiration models, merging of different remote sensing methods, application of data assimilation and fusion techniques in producing robust evapotranspiration estimates, and utilization of multi-source remote sensing data and latest sensor technologies. Further advances in the remote sensing of evapotranspiration will enhance capabilities for monitoring of the global water and energy cycles, including water availability and ecosystem responses and feedbacks to climate change and human impacts.

  abstract = {For water dynamics investigation in unsaturated (vadose) zones, ground penetrating radar is a popular hydro-geophysical method because it is non-invasive for soil, has high resolution and the results have a direct link with water content. Soil water content and soil hydraulic properties are two key factors for describing the water dynamics in vadose zones. There has been tremendous progress in soil water content and soil hydraulic properties estimation with ground penetrating radar. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the application of ground penetrating radar for soil water dynamics studies. This paper first summarizes various methods for the determination of soil water content. including traditional methods in the surveys of surface ground penetrating radar, borehole ground penetrating radar, and off-ground ground penetrating radar, as well as relatively new methods, such as full waveform inversion, the average envelope amplitude method, and the frequency shift method. This paper further provides a review for estimating soil hydraulic properties with GPR according to the types of ground penetrating radar data. We hope that this review can provide a reference for the application of ground penetrating radar in soil water dynamics studies in the future.},

  abstract = {The migration behaviors of antimony (Sb) and arsenic (As) and its influence factors have not been well understood among the different soils. In this study, we used lysimeter experiments to investigate the migration behavior of Sb compared with that of As in four representative soil materials from China. All the experiments processes and management measures were conducted to simulate the actual natural environmental conditions. Results indicated that after two years of leaching, the concentrations of Sb and As at the soil surface had decreased, whereas they increased in the deep soil profiles. In the polluted soil materials, 28.5\%--39.2\% of Sb and 0.4\%--1.3\% of As existed in the stable fraction, respectively. As and Sb levels were higher in the surface soil layer, and decreased with the soil depth in the different soil profiles. In soil leachate, Sb was mainly found in particle sizes smaller than 0.45 {$\mu$}m with the organic colloids, which had a peak in the spring and summer. On contrast, As was found in particle sizes larger than 0.45 {$\mu$}m with the inorganic colloids such as iron (Fe) and aluminum (Al) oxides. Pearson correlation results showed that the concentrations of Sb in the soil leaching solution and 0.45-{$\mu$}m-filltered solution were all positively correlated with Fe and Al. The results confirmed that Sb was combined with Fe and Al in the solution, and As posed a greater environmental risk than Sb during the leaching process. This study will help us to describe and predict As and Sb pollution in the soil environment, providing a basis for managing soil contaminated by these pollutants.},

Pollutants in different phases will eventually gather into the soil and water environments, and a series of migrations and transformations will take place at ecohydrological interfaces with water flow. However, it is still not clear how ecohydrological interfaces affect the migration and the transformation of pollutants. Therefore, this paper summarizes the physical, ecological, and biogeochemical characteristics of ecohydrological interfaces on the basis of introducing the development history of ecohydrology and the concept of ecohydrological interfaces. The effects of ecohydrological interfaces on the migration and transformation of heavy metals, organic pollutants, and carbon-nitrogen-phosphorus (C-N-P) pollutants are emphasized. Lastly, the prospects of applying ecohydrological interfaces for the removal of pollutants from the soil and water environment are put forward, including strengthening the ability to monitor and simulate ecohydrological systems at micro and macro scales, enhancing interdisciplinary research, and identifying main influencing factors that can provide theoretical basis and technical support.},

  abstract = {Rice is distributed worldwide; thus, quantitative analyses of water and heat fluxes between the land and air in paddy fields are vital for understanding basin-scale water cycles. In this study, eddy covariance and meteoro\- logical gradient systems on a 20-meter flux tower in the Jianghan Plain, Yangtze River Basin, China, were used to measure turbulent and meteorological parameters in paddy fields in 2021. Three micrometeorological methods, namely the eddy covariance (EC), Bowen Ratio-Energy Balance (BREB), and aerodynamic (AERO) methods, were used to calculate the latent heat flux (LE) and sensible heat flux (H); BREB and AERO are collectively referred to as gradient methods. The effects of measurement heights, growth stage, and weather conditions on the consis\- tency among them were analyzed. The difference in meteorological measurement heights affected the results of gradient methods. Among the five height combinations, the error in the 2 and 4 m combination was the smallest, and the coefficients of determination of LEEC--LEBREB/AERO and HEC--HBREB/AERO reached 0.96 and 0.84, respec\- tively. The stratification of the near-surface layer was formed due to the heterogeneous underlying surface of the experimental area, and the instrument needed to be installed within the range between roughness layer and new equilibrium layer. The height difference of gradient methods can be amplified within this range to avoid the influence of instrument resolution. The difference among methods was affected by growth stage, and weather conditions (sunny, cloudy, rainy days and different wind speed class). Both factors influenced atmospheric stability, and the error was the maximum in neutral stratification. This study provides a reference for the se\- lection of flux calculation methods and error analyses for paddy fields in humid areas.},

  abstract = {Assessing root sources of three uncertainties -- parameterization of soil hydraulic characteristics, boundary conditions, and estimation of source/sink terms -- is a significant challenge in soil water transport modeling. This study aims to evaluate the uncertainty of three each widely-used parameter estimation methods affecting plotscale water dynamics. The study employs HYDRUS, a process-based hydrologic model, to incorporate these uncertainties and compare model predictions to measured values in a semiarid Inner Mongolia steppe, China. Soil hydraulic parameters are determined using two direct methods (laboratory-derived approach and evaporation method) and one indirect method (neural network). While each hydraulic parameter method generally simulates soil moisture dynamics, the evaporation method performed better, especially under dry conditions. This suggests that measuring the intensity properties, such as unsaturated hydraulic conductivity, with the evaporation method is crucial for reasonable soil moisture simulation. The study also demonstrates the impact of different applied boundary conditions on simulated soil moisture, specifically the partitioning of reference FAO evapotranspiration via one direct method (soil fraction cover) and two indirect methods (leaf area index and crop height). The partitioning via soil fraction cover reflected a better simulation. Additionally, the study compares the uncertainties of root water uptake function with root growth parameters and constant root depth referenced to grass and pasture, and finds no significant difference among them. Comparing three sources of uncertainty in predicting soil moisture, the study concludes that the input soil hydraulic parameter is more sensitive than evapotranspiration partitioning or representation of root water uptake function. Our study highlights that measuring soil intensity properties can better reflect the effects of land use change, such as compaction, on field water transports.},

From finite-element forward modeling, sensitivity calculation to formation of initial model parameters, we systematically described the inversion calculation process of using patching algorithm . At the end, we gave out results about two numerical experiments and one field measured data inversion to illustrate the effectiveness of the algorithm. By patching algorithm, the initial soil resistivity model is step by step modified to make the calculated potential approximate that measured. Each measurement event (group of pole-pole array measurements which have same current electrode and input current) composes a step of modification to the model . This algorithm is appropriate when the data number for one measurement event is quite less than the parameter number of the model and the measurement event number varies with the equipment capacity or prospecting objectives , and even when the resistivity changes with time. Numerical experiments and field measured data inversion indicated the effectiveness of the inverse algorithm, but also revealed the difficulty of completely inversely calculating out the 3D subsurface soil resistivity only by using the data measured at the soil surface.},

  abstract = {A review article is presented of the research results obtained by the author on the properties of amorphous silica surface. It has been shown that in any description of the surface silica the hydroxylation of the surface is of critical importance. An analysis was made of the processes of dehydration (the removal of physically adsorbed water), dehydroxylation (the removal of silanol groups from the silica surface), and rehydroxylation (the restoration of the hydroxyl covering). For each of these processes a probable mechanism is suggested. The results of experimental and theoretical studies permitted to construct the original model (Zhuravlev model-1 and model-2) for describing the surface chemistry of amorphous silica. The main advantage of this physico-chemical model lies in the possibility to determine the concentration and the distribution of different types of silanol and siloxane groups and to characterize the energetic heterogeneity of the silica surface as a function of the pretreatment temperature of SiO2 samples. The model makes it possible to determine the kind of the chemisorption of water (rapid, weakly activated or slow, strongly activated) under the restoration of the hydroxyl covering and also to assess of OH groups inside the SiO2 skeleton. The magnitude of the silanol number, that is, the number of OH groups per unit surface area, hOH, when the surface is hydroxylated to the maximum degree, is considered to be a physico-chemical constant. This constant has a numerical value: hOH,AVER = 4.6 (least-squares method) and hOH,AVER = 4.9 OH nm-2 (arithmetical mean) and is known in literature as the Kiselev--Zhuravlev constant. It has been established that adsorption and other surface properties per unit surface area of silica are identical (except for very fine pores). On the basis of data published in the literature, this model has been found to be useful in solving various applied and theoretical problems in the field of adsorption, catalysis, chromatography, chemical modification, etc. It has been shown that the Brunauer -- Emmett--Teller (BET) method is the correct method and gives the opportunity to measure the real physical magnitude of the specific surface area, SKr (by using low temperature adsorption of krypton), for silicas and other oxide dispersed solids. {\copyright} 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract = {Spectral impedance measurements are receiving increased attention with regard to the characterization of soils, sediments and rocks, particularly in terms of the internal rock structure, the mineralogical composition and the chemistry of fluids contained in porous rocks. In fluid-saturated, porous sedimentary rocks, which are of particular relevance for many hydrological and environmental problems, the polarization processes that give rise to an observed phase shift between input current and output voltage signals are caused by the interaction of the electrolyte in the pores of the rock with electrically charged mineral surfaces. However, this phase response is relatively weak, typically smaller than 10 mrad and sometimes even of the order of only 1 mrad. In order to reliably measure such phase responses in the relevant frequency range, a high-accuracy impedance spectrometer is required. This system must allow phase measurements between 1 mHz and 1 kHz with a phase accuracy better than 0.1 mrad. In this paper, we present a new impedance spectrometer which meets these requirements. It is based on the four-point measurement method and offers a measurement range from 1 mHz to 45 kHz. Furthermore, we present design information for the sample holder and the electrodes, and methods for performing numerical corrections to reduce measurement errors. The overall accuracy of the setup was validated using water and sand with well-defined polarizable objects.},

This method determines the complex resistivity magnitude and phase images at a set of different measurement frequencies.

Here, typical phase values lie between 1 and 20 mrad only, requiring instrumentation with relatively high phase resolution and accuracy. In this paper, we present a new spectral EIT data acquisition system for laboratory applications, which operates in the frequency range from 1 mHz to 45 kHz and which was developed to meet these requirements. In this context, we also present a new measurement method based on current injection swapping, which leads to significantly improved phase images, particularly for higher measurement frequencies. The system and the new measurement method are tested on a water-filled tank and column containing different 2D and 3D targets (metallic and biological objects). The tests prove a phase accuracy of 1 mrad for frequencies of up to 1 kHz and higher, resulting in a clear discrimination of the objects on the basis of the reconstructed phase images.},

  abstract = {Soil moisture content on a horizontal scale of hectometers and at depths of decimeters can be inferred from measurements of low-energy cosmic-ray neutrons that are generated within soil, moderated mainly by hydrogen atoms, and diffused back to the atmosphere. These neutrons are sensitive to water content changes, but largely insensitive to variations in soil chemistry, and their intensity above the surface is inversely correlated with hydrogen content of the soil. The measurement with a portable neutron detector placed a few meters above the ground takes minutes to hours, permitting high-resolution, long-term monitoring of undisturbed soil moisture conditions. The large footprint makes the method suitable for weather and short-term climate forecast initialization and for calibration of satellite sensors, and the measurement depth makes the probe ideal for studies of plant/soil interaction and atmosphere/soil exchange.},

  abstract = {The newly-developed cosmic-ray method for measuring area-average soil moisture at the hectometer horizontal scale is being implemented in the COsmic-ray Soil Moisture Observing System (or the COSMOS). The stationary cosmic-ray soil moisture probe measures the neutrons that are generated by cosmic rays within air and soil and other materials, moderated by mainly hydrogen atoms located primarily in soil water, and emitted to the atmosphere where they mix instantaneously at a scale of hundreds of meters and whose density is inversely correlated with soil moisture. The COSMOS has already deployed more than 50 of the eventual 500 cosmic-ray probes, distributed mainly in the USA, each generating a time series of average soil moisture over its horizontal footprint, with similar networks coming into existence around the world. This paper is written to serve a community need to better understand this novel method and the COSMOS project. We describe the cosmic-ray soil moisture measurement method, the instrument and its calibration, the design, data processing and dissemination used in the COSMOS project, and give example time series of soil moisture obtained from COSMOS probes.},
