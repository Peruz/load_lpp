  abstract = {Abstract. Large weighing lysimeters are currently the most precise method to directly measure all components of the terrestrial water balance in parallel via the built-in weighing system. As lysimeters are exposed to several external forces such as management practices or wind influencing the weighing data, the calculated fluxes of precipitation and evapotranspiration can be altered considerably without having applied appropriate corrections to the raw data. Therefore, adequate filtering schemes for obtaining most accurate estimates of the water balance components are required. In this study, we use data from the TERENO (TERrestrial ENvironmental Observatories) SoilCan research site in Bad Lauchst{\"a}dt to develop a comprehensive filtering procedure for high-precision lysimeter data, which is designed to deal with various kinds of possible errors starting from the elimination of large disturbances in the raw data resulting e.g., from management practices all the way to the reduction of noise caused e.g., by moderate wind. Furthermore, we analyze the influence of averaging times and thresholds required by some of the filtering steps on the calculated water balance and investigate the ability of two adaptive filtering methods (the adaptive window and adaptive threshold filter (AWAT filter; Peters et al., 2014), and a new synchro filter applicable to the data from a set of several lysimeters) to further reduce the filtering error. Finally, we take advantage of the data sets of all 18 lysimeters running in parallel at the Bad Lauchst{\"a}dt site to evaluate the performance and accuracy of the proposed filtering scheme. For the tested time interval of 2 months, we show that the estimation of the water balance with high temporal resolution and good accuracy is possible.

Despite the fact that there is a wide variety of load cells, most of these transducers that are used in the weighing industry are based on strain gauges. In this paper, an s-beam load cell based on strain gauges was suitably assembled to the mechanical structure of several seats of a bus under performance tests and used to measure the resistance of their mechanical structure to tension forces applied horizontally to the seats being tested. The load cell was buried in a broadband noise background where the unwanted information and the relevant signal sometimes share a very similar frequency spectrum and its performance was improved by using a recursive least-squares (RLS) lattice algorithm. The experimental results are satisfactory and a significant improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio at the system output of 27 dB was achieved, which is a good performance factor for judging the quality of the system.},

Smart technologies assist in determining the positions of items and the movement to or from the shelves. Recently, several shelf tracking systems have been proposed utilizing sensor fusion, image processing, deep learning, and the Internet of Things. However, these systems suffer from the imbalance calibration of load cell sensors, high cost of hardware installation, and low positioning accuracy. Therefore, we propose an accurate online Weighing Distribution Positional Model that enables accurate load cell calibration and tracks item position and weight on shelves utilizing the load cells sensor fusion and deep learning. The load cell sensors are used to weigh shelves, and cameras are used to record the item's movement which is analyzed by image processing. Four well-known machine learning algorithms are tested on the system to identify the best operative environment. The system and the algorithms are evaluated using a real-world dataset consisting of item weights, and the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was found more accurate than the others with 97.61\% accuracy and zero error tolerance.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Understanding root signals and their consequences for the whole plant physiology is one of the keys to tackling the water-saving challenge in agriculture. The implementation of water-saving irrigation strategies, such as the partial root zone drying (PRD) method, is part of a comprehensive approach to enhance water use efficiency. To reach this goal tools are needed for the evaluation of the root's and soil water dynamics in time and space. In controlled laboratory conditions, using a rhizotron built for geoelectrical tomography imaging, we monitored the spatio-temporal changes in soil electrical resistivity (ER) for more than a month corresponding to eight alternating water inputs cycles. Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) was complemented with electrical current imaging (ECI) using plant-stem-induced electrical stimulation. To estimate soil water content in the rhizotron during the experiment, we incorporated Archie's law as a constitutive model. We demonstrated that under mild water stress conditions, it is practically impossible to spatially distinguish the limited-water-availability effects using ECI. We evidenced that the current source density spatial distribution varied during the course of the experiment with the transpiration demand but without any significant relationship to the soil water content changes. On the other hand, ERT showed spatial patterns associated with irrigation and, to a lesser degree, to RWU (root water uptake) and hydraulic redistribution. The interpretation of the geoelectrical imaging with respect to root activity was strengthened and correlated with indirect observations of the plant transpiration using a weight monitoring lysimeter and direct observation of the plant leaf gas exchanges.},

The analyzed system form a part of the horticultural fruits sorting machine, which requires a fast and reliable weight measurements. Dynamic weighing of moving objects requires fast and adaptive signal processing techniques in order to guaranty a timely response. Thus, applied signal filtration technique must ensure that the constant component remains free of noise, transient responses of load cell as well as mechanical vibrations. In this paper fast nonstationary filtering method is applied, providing optimal tradeoff between response time and settling time of steady state value. The implementation method uses the distributed approach, where an intelligent sensor captures raw signal and applies adaptive filter. Subsequently, obtained value is transmitted to central unit, that applies weight compensation function to improve the measurement accuracy. All presented results use the real signal acquired in industrial conditions from the tests of sorting machine prototype. The analyzed approach obtains promising results for all sorting modes. Moreover, classical filtering approach is used for comparison purposes and performance evaluation.},

  abstract = {Weighing lysimeters yield the most precise and realistic measures for evapotranspiration (ET) and precipitation (P ), which are of great importance for many questions regarding soil and atmospheric sciences. An increase or a decrease of the system mass (lysimeter plus seepage) indicates P or ET. These real mass changes of the lysimeter system have to be separated from measurement noise (e.g., caused by wind). A promising approach to filter noisy lysimeter data is (i) to introduce a smoothing routine, like a moving average with a certain averaging window, w, and then (ii) to apply a certain threshold value, {$\delta$}, accounting for measurement accuracy, separating significant from insignificant weight changes. Thus, two filter parameters are used, namely w and {$\delta$}. In particular, the time-variable noise due to wind as well as strong signals due to heavy precipitation pose challenges for such noise-reduction algorithms. If w is too small, data noise might be interpreted as real system changes. If w is too wide, small weight changes in short time intervals might be disregarded. The same applies to too small or too large values for {$\delta$}. Application of constant w and {$\delta$} leads either to unnecessary losses of accuracy or to faulty data due to noise. The aim of this paper is to solve this problem with a new filter routine that is appropriate for any event, ranging from smooth evaporation to strong wind and heavy precipitation. Therefore, the new routine uses adaptive w and {$\delta$} in dependence on signal strength and noise (AWAT -- adaptive window and adaptive threshold filter). The AWAT filter, a moving-average filter and the Savitzky--Golay filter with constant w and {$\delta$} were applied to real lysimeter data comprising the above-mentioned events. The AWAT filter was the only filter that could handle the data of all events very well. A sensitivity study shows that the magnitude of the maximum threshold value has practically no influence on the results; thus only the maximum window width must be predefined by the user.},

  abstract = {Weighing lysimeters with appropriate data filtering yield the most precise and unbiased information for precipitation (P ) and evapotranspiration (ET). A recently introduced filter scheme for such data is the AWAT (Adaptive Window and Adaptive Threshold) filter (Peters et al., 2014). The filter applies an adaptive threshold to separate significant from insignificant mass changes, guaranteeing that P and ET are not overestimated, and uses a step interpolation between the significant mass changes. In this contribution we show that the step interpolation scheme, which reflects the resolution of the measuring system, can lead to unrealistic prediction of P and ET, especially if they are required in high temporal resolution. We introduce linear and spline interpolation schemes to overcome these problems. To guarantee that medium to strong precipitation events abruptly following low or zero fluxes are not smoothed in an unfavourable way, a simple heuristic selection criterion is used, which attributes such precipitations to the step interpolation. The three interpolation schemes (step, linear and spline) are tested and compared using a data set from a grass-reference lysimeter with 1 min resolution, ranging from 1 January to 5 August 2014. The selected output resolutions for P and ET prediction are 1 day, 1 h and 10 min. As expected, the step scheme yielded reasonable flux rates only for a resolution of 1 day, whereas the other two schemes are well able to yield reasonable results for any resolution. The spline scheme returned slightly better results than the linear scheme concerning the differences between filtered values and raw data. Moreover, this scheme allows continuous differentiability of filtered data so that any output resolution for the fluxes is sound. Since computational burden is not problematic for any of the interpolation schemes, we suggest always using the spline scheme.},
